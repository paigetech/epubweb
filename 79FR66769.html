    <p id="p-3" data-page="66770">This final rule with comment period revises the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system for CY 2015 to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. In this final rule with comment period, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare services paid under the OPPS and those paid under the ASC payment system. In addition, this final rule with comment period updates and refines the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program and the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program.</p>
            <p id="p-4" data-page="66770">In this document, we also are making changes to the data sources permitted for expansion requests for physician-owned hospitals under the physician self-referral regulations; changes to the underlying authority for the requirement of an admission order for all hospital inpatient admissions and changes to require physician certification for hospital inpatient admissions only for long-stay cases and outlier cases; and changes to establish a formal process, including a three-level appeals process, to recoup overpayments that result from the submission of erroneous payment data by Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations and Part D sponsors in the limited circumstances in which the organization or sponsor fails to correct these data.</p>

<h4><a name="13"></a>A. Executive Summary of This Document</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Purpose</b></p>

          <p id="p-589" data-page="66775">In this final rule with comment period, we are updating the payment policies and payment rates for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in hospital outpatient departments and<span id="page-66776" class="printed_page" data-page="66776"> </span>Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) beginning January 1, 2015. Section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to annually review and update the relative payment weights and the conversion factor for services payable under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). Under section 1833(i) of the Act, we annually review and update the ASC payment rates. We describe these and various other statutory authorities in the relevant sections of this final rule with comment period. In addition, this final rule with comment period updates and refines the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program and the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program.</p>
          <p id="p-590" data-page="66776">In this document, we also are making changes to the data sources permitted for expansion requests for physician-owned hospitals under the physician self-referral regulations; changes to the underlying authority for the requirement of an admission order for all hospital inpatient admissions and changes to require physician certification for hospital inpatient admissions only for long-stay cases and outlier cases; and changes to establish a formal process, including a three-level appeals process, to recoup overpayments that result from the submission of erroneous payment data by Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations and Part D sponsors in the limited circumstances in which the organization or sponsor fails to correct these data.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Summary of the Major Provisions</b></p>
          <ul class="bullets"><li id="p-591" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">OPPS Update:</i> For CY 2015, we are increasing the payment rates under the OPPS by an Outpatient Department (OPD) fee schedule increase factor of 2.2 percent. This increase is based on the final hospital inpatient market basket percentage increase of 2.9 percent for inpatient services paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), minus the multifactor productivity (MFP) adjustment of 0.5 percentage point, and minus a 0.2 percentage point adjustment required by the Affordable Care Act. Under this final rule with comment period, we estimate that total payments for CY 2015, including beneficiary cost-sharing, to the approximate 4,000 facilities paid under the OPPS (including general acute care hospitals, children&apos;s hospitals, cancer hospitals, and community mental health centers (CMHCs)), will be approximately $56.1 billion, an increase of approximately $5.1 billion compared to CY 2014 payments, or $900 million excluding our estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix.</li></ul>
          <p id="p-592" data-page="66776">We are continuing to implement the statutory 2.0 percentage point reduction in payments for hospitals failing to meet the hospital outpatient quality reporting requirements, by applying a reporting factor of 0.980 to the OPPS payments and copayments for all applicable services.</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-593" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Rural Adjustment:</i> We are continuing the adjustment of 7.1 percent to the OPPS payments to certain rural sole community hospitals (SCHs), including essential access community hospitals (EACHs). This adjustment will apply to all services paid under the OPPS, excluding separately payable drugs and biologicals, devices paid under the pass-through payment policy, and items paid at charges reduced to cost.</li>
          <li id="p-594" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Cancer Hospital Payment Adjustment:</i> For CY 2015, we are continuing to provide additional payments to cancer hospitals so that the cancer hospital&apos;s payment-to-cost ratio (PCR) after the additional payments is equal to the weighted average PCR for the other OPPS hospitals using the most recently submitted or settled cost report data. Based on those data, a target PCR of 0.89 will be used to determine the CY 2015 cancer hospital payment adjustment to be paid at cost report settlement. That is, the payment adjustments will be the additional payments needed to result in a PCR equal to 0.89 for each cancer hospital.</li>
          <li id="p-595" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Payment of Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals:</i> For CY 2015, payment for the acquisition and pharmacy overhead costs of separately payable drugs and biologicals that do not have pass-through status are set at the statutory default of average sales price (ASP) plus 6 percent.</li>
          <li id="p-596" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Packaging Policies:</i> We are conditionally packaging certain ancillary services when they are integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service. The initial set of services packaged under this ancillary service policy are the services assigned to APCs having an APC geometric mean cost (prior to application of status indicator Q1) of less than or equal to $100. This $100 geometric mean cost limit for the APC is part of the methodology of establishing an initial set of conditionally packaged ancillary service APCs, and is not meant to represent a threshold above which a given ancillary service will not be packaged, but as a basis for selecting an initial set of APCs that will likely be updated and expanded in future years.</li>
          <li id="p-597" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Implementation of Comprehensive APCs:</i> For CY 2015, we are implementing, with several modifications, the policy for comprehensive APCs (C-APCs) that was finalized in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period effective January 1, 2015. We are continuing to define the services assigned to C-APCs as primary services, and to define a C-APC as a classification for the provision of a primary service and all adjunctive services and supplies provided to support the delivery of the primary service. We continue to consider the entire hospital stay, defined as all services reported on the hospital claim reporting the primary service, to be one comprehensive service for the provision of a primary service into which all other services appearing on the claim would be packaged. This results in a single Medicare payment and a single beneficiary copayment under the OPPS for the comprehensive service based on all included charges on the claim.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-598" data-page="66776">We are establishing a total of 25 C-APCs for CY 2015, including all of the formerly device-dependent APCs remaining after some restructuring and consolidation of these APCs (except for APCs 0427, 0622, and 0652) and two C-APCs for other procedures that are either largely device-dependent or represent single session services with multiple components (single-session cranial stereotactic radiosurgery and intraocular telescope implantation). We are modifying the complexity adjustment criteria finalized last year by lowering volume and cost threshold criteria for complexity adjustments. Finally, we are packaging all add-on codes furnished as part of a comprehensive service, which is consistent with our general add-on code packaging policy. However, the add-on codes assigned to the CY 2014 device-dependent APCs will be being evaluated with a primary service for a potential complexity adjustment.</p>

<i class="E-03">Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Update:</i> For CY 2015, we are increasing payment rates under the ASC payment system by 1.4 percent. This increase is based on a projected CPI-U update of 1.9 percent minus a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the Affordable Care Act that is projected to be 0.5 percentage point. Based on this update, we estimate that total payments to ASCs (including beneficiary cost-sharing and estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix), for CY 2015 will be approximately $4.147 billion, an increase of approximately $236 million compared to estimated CY 2014 Medicare payments.<span id="page-66777" class="printed_page" data-page="66777"> </span>

<i class="E-03">Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program:</i> For the Hospital OQR Program, we are adding one claims-based quality measure for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years instead of the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years as proposed. However, prior to publicly reporting this measure, we plan to conduct a dry run (a preliminary analysis) for hospitals to review their performance and provide feedback using the most recently available data. There will be no payment impact during this dry-run period, and the results of the dry run will not be publicly reported. We are refining the criteria for determining &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; measures, and we are removing the OP-6 and OP-7 measures due to &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; status. In addition, we are updating several previously adopted measures. We are clarifying data submission requirements for OP-27 and are noting a delayed data collection for OP-29 and OP-30. We are excluding one previously adopted measure (OP-31) from the measure set for the CY 2016 payment determination and changing this measure from required to voluntary for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. We will not subject hospitals to payment reductions with respect to the OP-31 measure for the CY 2016 payment determination or during the period of voluntary reporting. In addition, we are formalizing a review and corrections period for chart-abstracted measures. We also are updating validation procedures and changes to regulation text to correct typographical errors. We are changing the eligibility criteria for validation; a hospital will only be eligible for random selection for validation if it submits at least 12 cases to the Hospital OQR Program Clinical Data Warehouse during the quarter with the most recently available data. Hospitals also will have the option to submit validation data using electronic methods and must identify the medical record staff responsible for submission of records to the designated CMS contractor. Finally, we are clarifying how we refer to the extraordinary circumstances extensions or exemptions process.</li>
          <li id="p-601" data-page="66777">
<i class="E-03">Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program:</i> For the ASCQR Program, we are adopting one new quality measure (ASC-12) for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years. This measure will be computed using paid Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims data and will not impose any additional burden on ASCs. We also are excluding one measure (ASC-11) previously adopted for the CY 2016 payment determination and providing that this measure may be voluntarily rather than mandatorily reported for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. We will not subject ASCs to payment reductions with respect to this measure for the CY 2016 payment determination or during the period of voluntary reporting. In addition, we are establishing a measure removal process and criteria, defining data collection timeframes and submission deadlines, and clarifying how we refer to the extraordinary circumstances extensions or exemptions process.</li>

          <br><p><b>3. Summary of Costs and Benefits</b></p>
          <p id="p-602" data-page="66777">In sections XXI. and XXII. of this final rule with comment period, we set forth a detailed analysis of the regulatory and federalism impacts that the changes will have on affected entities and beneficiaries. Key estimated impacts are described below.</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Impacts of the OPPS Update</b></p>
          <br><p><b>(1) Impacts of All OPPS Changes</b></p>
          <p id="p-603" data-page="66777">Table 49 in section XXI. of this final rule with comment period displays the distributional impact of all the OPPS changes on various groups of hospitals and CMHCs for CY 2015 compared to all estimated OPPS payments in CY 2014. We estimate that the policies in this final rule with comment period will result in a 2.3 percent overall increase in OPPS payments to providers. We estimate that total OPPS payments for CY 2015, including beneficiary cost-sharing, to the approximate 4,000 facilities paid under the OPPS (including general acute care hospitals, children&apos;s hospitals, cancer hospitals, and CMHCs) will be approximately $56.1 billion, an increase of approximately $5.1 billion compared to CY 2014 payments, or $900 million, excluding our estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix.</p>
          <p id="p-604" data-page="66777">We estimated the isolated impact of our OPPS policies on CMHCs because CMHCs are only paid for partial hospitalization services under the OPPS. Continuing the provider-specific structure that we adopted beginning in CY 2011 and basing payment fully on the type of provider furnishing the service, we estimate a 1.3 percent increase in CY 2015 payments to CMHCs relative to their CY 2014 payments.</p>
          <br><p><b>(2) Impacts of the Updated Wage Indexes</b></p>
          <p id="p-605" data-page="66777">We estimate that our update of the wage indexes and application of the frontier State wage index, including changes resulting from the adoption of the new OMB labor market area delineations and the transitional 1-year, 50/50 blended wage index, will mitigate any negative changes due to the new CBSA delineations.</p>
          <br><p><b>(3) Impacts of the Rural Adjustment and the Cancer Hospital Payment Adjustment</b></p>
          <p id="p-606" data-page="66777">There are no significant impacts of our CY 2015 payment policies for hospitals that are eligible for the rural adjustment or for the cancer hospital payment adjustment. We are not making any change in policies for determining the rural and cancer hospital payment adjustments, and the adjustment amounts do not significantly impact the budget neutrality adjustments for these policies.</p>
          <br><p><b>(4) Impacts of the OPD Fee Schedule Increase Factor</b></p>
          <p id="p-607" data-page="66777">We estimate that, for most hospitals, the application of the OPD fee schedule increase factor of 2.2 percent to the conversion factor for CY 2015 will mitigate the small negative impacts of the budget neutrality adjustments. As a result of the OPD fee schedule increase factor and other budget neutrality adjustments, we estimate that urban and rural hospitals will experience increases of approximately 2.3 percent for urban hospitals and 1.9 percent for rural hospitals. Classifying hospitals by teaching status or type of ownership suggests that these hospitals will receive similar increases.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Impacts of the ASC Payment Update</b></p>
          <p id="p-608" data-page="66777">For impact purposes, the surgical procedures on the ASC list of covered procedures are aggregated into surgical specialty groups using CPT and HCPCS code range definitions. The percentage change in estimated total payments by specialty groups under the CY 2015 payment rates compared to estimated CY 2014 payment rates ranges between &#x2212;4.0 percent for ancillary items and services and 14 percent for hematologic and lymphatic system procedures.</p>
          <br><p><b>c. Impacts of the Hospital OQR Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-609" data-page="66777">We do not expect our CY 2015 policies to significantly affect the number of hospitals that do not receive a full annual payment update.</p>
          <br><p><b>d. Impacts of the ASCQR Program</b></p>

          <p id="p-610" data-page="66777">We do not expect our CY 2015 proposed policies to significantly affect the number of ASCs that do not receive a full annual payment update.<span id="page-66778" class="printed_page" data-page="66778"> </span>

<h4><a name="25"></a>B. Legislative and Regulatory Authority for the Hospital OPPS</h4>

          <p id="p-611" data-page="66778">When Title XVIII of the Social Security Act was enacted, Medicare payment for hospital outpatient services was based on hospital-specific costs. In an effort to ensure that Medicare and its beneficiaries pay appropriately for services and to encourage more efficient delivery of care, the Congress mandated replacement of the reasonable cost-based payment methodology with a prospective payment system (PPS). The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) (<a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=105&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=33&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub. L. 105-33</a>) added section 1833(t) to the Act authorizing implementation of a PPS for hospital outpatient services. The OPPS was first implemented for services furnished on or after August 1, 2000. Implementing regulations for the OPPS are located at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-410">42 CFR Parts 410</a> and 419.</p>

          <p id="p-613" data-page="66778">Under the OPPS, we pay for hospital Part B services on a rate-per-service basis that varies according to the APC group to which the service is assigned. We use the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) (which includes certain Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes) to identify and group the services within each APC. The OPPS includes payment for most hospital outpatient services, except those identified in section I.C. of this final rule with comment period. Section 1833(t)(1)(B) of the Act provides for payment under the OPPS for hospital outpatient services designated by the Secretary (which includes partial hospitalization services furnished by CMHCs), and certain inpatient hospital services that are paid under Part B.</p>
          <p id="p-614" data-page="66778">The OPPS rate is an unadjusted national payment amount that includes the Medicare payment and the beneficiary copayment. This rate is divided into a labor-related amount and a nonlabor-related amount. The labor-related amount is adjusted for area wage differences using the hospital inpatient wage index value for the locality in which the hospital or CMHC is located.</p>
          <p id="p-615" data-page="66778">All services and items within an APC group are comparable clinically and with respect to resource use (section 1833(t)(2)(B) of the Act). In accordance with section 1833(t)(2) of the Act, subject to certain exceptions, items and services within an APC group cannot be considered comparable with respect to the use of resources if the highest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary) for an item or service in the APC group is more than 2 times greater than the lowest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary) for an item or service within the same APC group (referred to as the &#x201C;2 times rule&#x201D;). In implementing this provision, we generally use the cost of the item or service assigned to an APC group.</p>
          <p id="p-616" data-page="66778">For new technology items and services, special payments under the OPPS may be made in one of two ways. Section 1833(t)(6) of the Act provides for temporary additional payments, which we refer to as &#x201C;transitional pass-through payments,&#x201D; for at least 2 but not more than 3 years for certain drugs, biological agents, brachytherapy devices used for the treatment of cancer, and categories of other medical devices. For new technology services that are not eligible for transitional pass-through payments, and for which we lack sufficient clinical information and cost data to appropriately assign them to a clinical APC group, we have established special APC groups based on costs, which we refer to as New Technology APCs. These New Technology APCs are designated by cost bands which allow us to provide appropriate and consistent payment for designated new procedures that are not yet reflected in our claims data. Similar to pass-through payments, an assignment to a New Technology APC is temporary; that is, we retain a service within a New Technology APC until we acquire sufficient data to assign it to a clinically appropriate APC group.</p>

<h4><a name="26"></a>C. Excluded OPPS Services and Hospitals</h4>

          <p id="p-617" data-page="66778">Section 1833(t)(1)(B)(i) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to designate the hospital outpatient services that are paid under the OPPS. While most hospital outpatient services are payable under the OPPS, section 1833(t)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act excludes payment for ambulance, physical and occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services, for which payment is made under a fee schedule. It also excludes screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, and effective January 1, 2011, an annual wellness visit providing personalized prevention plan services. The Secretary exercises the authority granted under the statute to also exclude from the OPPS certain services that are paid under fee schedules or other payment systems. Such excluded services include, for example, the professional services of physicians and nonphysician practitioners paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS); certain laboratory services paid under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS); services for beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that are paid under the ESRD prospective payment system; and services and procedures that require an inpatient stay that are paid under the hospital IPPS.

<h4><a name="28"></a>E. Advisory Panel on Hospital Outpatient Payment (the HOP Panel or the Panel)</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Authority of the Panel</b></p>
          <p id="p-621" data-page="66779">Section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act, as amended by section 201(h) of <a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=106&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=113&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 106-113</a>, and redesignated by section 202(a)(2) of <a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=106&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=113&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 106-113</a>, requires that we consult with an external advisory panel of experts to annually review the clinical integrity of the payment groups and their weights under the OPPS. In CY 2000, based on section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act and section 222 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, the Secretary established the Advisory Panel on Ambulatory Payment Classification Groups (APC Panel) to fulfill this requirement. In CY 2011, based on section 222 of the PHS Act which gives discretionary authority to the Secretary to convene advisory councils and committees, the Secretary expanded the panel&apos;s scope to include the supervision of hospital outpatient therapeutic services in addition to the APC groups and weights. To reflect this new role of the panel, the Secretary changed the panel&apos;s name to the Advisory Panel on Hospital Outpatient Payment (the HOP Panel, or the Panel). The Panel is not restricted to using data compiled by CMS, and in conducting its review it may use data collected or developed by organizations outside the Department.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Establishment of the Panel</b></p>
          <p id="p-622" data-page="66779">On November 21, 2000, the Secretary signed the initial charter establishing the HOP Panel, at that time named the APC Panel. This expert panel, which may be composed of up to 19 appropriate representatives of providers (currently employed full-time, not as consultants, in their respective areas of expertise), reviews clinical data and advises CMS about the clinical integrity of the APC groups and their payment weights. Since CY 2012, the Panel also is charged with advising the Secretary on the appropriate level of supervision for individual hospital outpatient therapeutic services. The Panel is technical in nature, and it is governed by the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The current charter specifies, among other requirements, that: The Panel continues to be technical in nature; is governed by the provisions of the FACA; may convene up to three meetings per year; has a Designated Federal Official (DFO); and is chaired by a Federal Official designated by the Secretary. The current charter was amended on November 15, 2011, and the Panel was renamed to reflect expanding the Panel&apos;s authority to include supervision of hospital outpatient therapeutic services and therefore to add CAHs to its membership.</p>

          <br><p><b>3. Panel Meetings and Organizational Structure</b></p>

          <p id="p-624" data-page="66779">The Panel has held multiple meetings, with the last meeting taking place on August 25, 2014. Prior to each meeting, we publish a notice in the <span class="E-04">Federal Register</span> to announce the meeting and, when necessary, to solicit nominations for Panel membership and to announce new members.</p>
          <p id="p-625" data-page="66779">The Panel has established an operational structure that, in part, currently includes the use of three subcommittees to facilitate its required review process. The three current subcommittees are the Data Subcommittee, the Visits and Observation Subcommittee, and the Subcommittee for APC Groups and Status Indicator (SI) Assignments.</p>
          <p id="p-626" data-page="66779">The Data Subcommittee is responsible for studying the data issues confronting the Panel and for recommending options for resolving them. The Visits and Observation Subcommittee reviews and makes recommendations to the Panel on all technical issues pertaining to observation services and hospital outpatient visits paid under the OPPS (for example, APC configurations and APC relative payment weights). The Subcommittee for APC Groups and SI Assignments advises the Panel on the following issues: The appropriate SIs to be assigned to HCPCS codes, including but not limited to whether a HCPCS code or a category of codes should be packaged or separately paid; and the appropriate APC placement of HCPCS codes regarding services for which separate payment is made.</p>
          <p id="p-627" data-page="66779">Each of these subcommittees was established by a majority vote from the full Panel during a scheduled Panel meeting, and the Panel recommended at the August 2014 meeting that the subcommittees continue. We accepted this recommendation.</p>

          <p id="p-628" data-page="66779">Discussions of the other recommendations made by the Panel at the August 2014 Panel meeting are included in the sections of this final rule with comment period that are specific to each recommendation. For discussions of earlier Panel meetings and recommendations, we refer readers to previously published OPPS/ASC proposed and final rules, the CMS Web site mentioned earlier in this section, and the FACA database at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://fido.gov/facadatabase/public.asp" class="external wrap">http://fido.gov/facadatabase/public.asp</a></i>.</p>

<h3>I. Beneficiary Copayments</h3>

          <br><p><b>1. Background</b></p>
          <p id="p-1075" data-page="66836">Section 1833(t)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to set rules for determining the unadjusted copayment amounts to be paid by beneficiaries for covered OPD services. Section 1833(t)(8)(C)(ii) of the Act specifies that the Secretary must reduce the national unadjusted copayment amount for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year in a manner so that the effective copayment rate (determined on a national unadjusted basis) for that service in the year does not exceed a specified percentage. As specified in section 1833(t)(8)(C)(ii)(V) of the Act, the effective copayment rate for a covered OPD service paid under the OPPS in CY 2006, and in calendar years thereafter, shall not exceed 40 percent of the APC payment rate.</p>
          <p id="p-1076" data-page="66836">Section 1833(t)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that, for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year, the national unadjusted copayment amount cannot be less than 20 percent of the OPD fee schedule amount. However, section 1833(t)(8)(C)(i) of the Act limits the amount of beneficiary copayment that may be collected for a procedure performed in a year to the amount of the inpatient hospital deductible for that year.</p>
          <p id="p-1077" data-page="66836">Section 4104 of the Affordable Care Act eliminated the Part B coinsurance for preventive services furnished on and after January 1, 2011, that meet certain requirements, including flexible sigmoidoscopies and screening colonoscopies, and waived the Part B deductible for screening colonoscopies that become diagnostic during the procedure. Our discussion of the changes made by the Affordable Care Act with regard to copayments for preventive services furnished on and after January 1, 2011, may be found in section XII.B. of the CY 2011 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/75-FR-72013">75 FR 72013</a>).</p>
          <br><p><b>2. OPPS Copayment Policy</b></p>
          <p id="p-1078" data-page="66836">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40973">79 FR 40973</a>), for CY 2015, we proposed to determine copayment amounts for new and revised APCs using the same methodology that we implemented beginning in CY 2004. (We refer readers to the November 7, 2003 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/68-FR-63458">68 FR 63458</a>).) In addition, we proposed to use the same standard rounding principles that we have historically used in instances where the application of our standard copayment methodology would result in a copayment amount that is less than 20 percent and cannot be rounded, under standard rounding principles, to 20 percent. (We refer readers to the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/72-FR-66687">72 FR 66687</a>) in which we discuss our rationale for applying these rounding principles.) The proposed national unadjusted copayment amounts for services payable under the OPPS that would be effective January 1, 2015, were shown in Addenda A and B to the proposed rule (which are available via the Internet on the CMS Web site). As discussed in section XII.G. of the proposed rule, for CY 2015, the Medicare beneficiary&apos;s minimum unadjusted copayment and national unadjusted copayment for a service to which a reduced national unadjusted payment rate applies equals the product of the reporting ratio and the national unadjusted copayment, or the product of the reporting ratio and the minimum unadjusted copayment, respectively, for the service.</p>
          <p id="p-1079" data-page="66836">We note that OPPS copayments may increase or decrease each year based on changes in the calculated APC payment rates due to updated cost report and claims data, and any changes to the OPPS cost modeling process. However, as described in the CY 2004 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, the development of the copayment methodology generally moves beneficiary copayments closer to 20 percent of OPPS APC payments (<a href="/citation/68-FR-63458">68 FR 63458</a> through 63459).</p>
          <p id="p-1080" data-page="66836">We did not receive any public comments regarding the proposed methodology for calculating copayments for CY 2015. Therefore, for the reasons set forth in this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposed CY 2015 copayment methodology without modification.</p>
          <br><p><b>3. Calculation of an Adjusted Copayment Amount for an APC Group</b></p>
          <p id="p-1081" data-page="66836">Individuals interested in calculating the national copayment liability for a Medicare beneficiary for a given service provided by a hospital that met or failed to meet its Hospital OQR Program requirements should follow the formulas presented in the following steps.</p>
          <p id="p-1082" data-page="66836">
            <i class="E-03">Step 1.</i> Calculate the beneficiary payment percentage for the APC by dividing the APC&apos;s national unadjusted copayment by its payment rate. For example, using APC 0019, approximately $75.68 is 20 percent of the full national unadjusted payment rate of approximately $378.41. For APCs with only a minimum unadjusted copayment in Addenda A and B to this final rule with comment period (which are available via the Internet on the CMS Web site), the beneficiary payment percentage is 20 percent.</p>
          <p id="p-1083" data-page="66836">The formula below is a mathematical representation of Step 1 and calculates the national copayment as a percentage of national payment for a given service.</p>
          
          <p id="p-1084" data-page="66836">
            <i class="E-03">B is the beneficiary payment percentage.</i>
          </p>
          <p id="p-1085" data-page="66836">
            <i class="E-03">B</i>= National unadjusted copayment for APC/national unadjusted payment rate for APC.</p>
          
          <p id="p-1086" data-page="66836">
            <i class="E-03">Step 2.</i> Calculate the appropriate wage-adjusted payment rate for the APC for the provider in question, as indicated in Steps 2 through 4 under section II.H. of this final rule with comment period. Calculate the rural adjustment for eligible providers as indicated in Step 6 under section II.H. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <p id="p-1087" data-page="66836">
            <i class="E-03">Step 3.</i> Multiply the percentage calculated in Step 1 by the payment rate calculated in Step 2. The result is the wage-adjusted copayment amount for the APC.</p>
          <p id="p-1088" data-page="66836">The formula below is a mathematical representation of Step 3 and applies the beneficiary payment percentage to the adjusted payment rate for a service calculated under section II.H. of this final rule with comment period, with and without the rural adjustment, to calculate the adjusted beneficiary copayment for a given service.</p>

          <p id="p-1089" data-page="66836">Wage-adjusted copayment amount for the APC = Adjusted Medicare Payment *<i class="E-03">B.</i>
          </p>

          <p id="p-1090" data-page="66836">Wage-adjusted copayment amount for the APC (SCH or EACH) = (Adjusted Medicare Payment * 1.071) *<i class="E-03">B.</i>
          </p>
          <p id="p-1091" data-page="66836">
            <i class="E-03">Step 4.</i> For a hospital that failed to meet its Hospital OQR Program requirements, multiply the copayment calculated in Step 3 by the reporting ratio of 0.980.</p>
          <p id="p-1092" data-page="66836">The unadjusted copayments for services payable under the OPPS that will be effective January 1, 2015, are shown in Addenda A and B to this final rule with comment period (which are available via the Internet on the CMS Web site). We note that the national unadjusted payment rates and copayment rates shown in Addenda A and B to this final rule with comment period reflect the full CY 2015 OPD fee schedule increase factor discussed in section II.B. of this final rule with comment period.</p>

          <p id="p-1093" data-page="66836">In addition, as noted above, section 1833(t)(8)(C)(i) of the Act limits the amount of beneficiary copayment that may be collected for a procedure performed in a year to the amount of the inpatient hospital deductible for that year.<span id="page-66837" class="printed_page" data-page="66837"> </span>

<h4><a name="88"></a>A. OPPS Treatment of New CPT and Level II HCPCS Codes</h4>

          <p id="p-1094" data-page="66837">CPT and Level II HCPCS codes are used to report procedures, services, items, and supplies under the hospital OPPS. Specifically, CMS recognizes the following codes on OPPS claims:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1095" data-page="66837"> Category I CPT codes, which describe surgical procedures and medical services;</li>
          <li id="p-1096" data-page="66837"> Category III CPT codes, which describe new and emerging technologies, services, and procedures; and</li>
          <li id="p-1097" data-page="66837"> Level II HCPCS codes, which are used primarily to identify products, supplies, temporary procedures, and services not described by CPT codes.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-1098" data-page="66837">CPT codes are established by the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Level II HCPCS codes are established by the CMS HCPCS Workgroup. These codes are updated and changed throughout the year. CPT and HCPCS code changes that affect the OPPS are published both through the annual rulemaking cycle and through the OPPS quarterly update Change Requests (CRs). CMS releases new Level II HCPCS codes to the public or recognizes the release of new CPT codes by the AMA and makes these codes effective (that is, the codes can be reported on Medicare claims) outside of the formal rulemaking process via OPPS quarterly update CRs. Based on our review, we assign the new CPT and Level II HCPCS codes to interim status indicator (SI) and APC assignments. These interim assignments are finalized in the OPPS/ASC final rules. This quarterly process offers hospitals access to codes that may more accurately describe items or services furnished and/or provides payment or more accurate payment for these items or services in a timelier manner than if CMS waited for the annual rulemaking process. We solicit public comments on these new codes and finalize our proposals related to these codes through our annual rulemaking process.</p>
          <p id="p-1099" data-page="66837">We note that, under the OPPS, the APC assignment determines the payment rate for an item, procedure, or service. Items, procedures, or services not paid separately under the hospital OPPS are assigned to the appropriate status indicators. Section XI. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule provided a discussion of the various status indicators used under the OPPS. Assigning procedures to certain status indicators would generate separate payment for the service furnished, while assignment to other status indicators would not.</p>
          <p id="p-1100" data-page="66837">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40974">79 FR 40974</a>), in Table 14 (Table 15 of this final rule with comment period), we summarized our process for updating codes through our OPPS quarterly update CRs, seeking public comments, and finalizing their treatment under the OPPS. We noted that because the payment rates associated with codes effective July 1 were not available to us in time for incorporation into the Addenda to the proposed rule, the Level II HCPCS codes and the Category III CPT codes implemented through the July 2014 OPPS quarterly update CR were not included in Addendum B of the proposed rule (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site), while those codes based upon the April 2014 OPPS quarterly update were included in Addendum B. Nevertheless, we requested public comments on the codes included in the July 2014 OPPS quarterly update and included these codes in the preamble of the proposed rule.</p>

          <p id="p-1101" data-page="66837">This process is discussed in detail below. We have separated our discussion into two sections based on whether we solicited public comments in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule or whether we will be soliciting public comments in this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. We note that we will be seeking public comments in this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period on the interim APC and status indicator assignments for new CPT and Level II HCPCS codes that will be effective January 1, 2015. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40977">79 FR 40977</a>), we also noted that we sought public comments in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period on the interim APC and status assignments for new Level II HCPCS codes that became effective October 1, 2013, or January 1, 2014. These new and revised codes, with an effective date of October 1, 2013, or January 1, 2014, were flagged with comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; (New code, interim APC assignment; comments will be accepted on the interim APC assignment for the new code) in Addendum B to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period to indicate that we were assigning them an interim payment status and an APC and payment rate, if applicable, and were subject to public comment following publication of the<span id="page-66838" class="printed_page" data-page="66838"> </span>CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. We are responding to public comments and finalizing our interim OPPS treatment of these codes in this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period.</p>
          <p id="p-1102" data-page="66838">We received public comments on some new codes that were assigned to comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; in Addendum B of the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. We respond to those comments in sections III.C. of this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>1. Treatment of New CY 2014 Level II HCPCS and CPT Codes Effective April 1, 2014 and July 1, 2014 for Which We Solicited Public Comments in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC Proposed Rule</b></p>
          <p id="p-1103" data-page="66838">Through the April 2014 OPPS quarterly update CR (Transmittal 2903, Change Request 8653, dated March 11, 2014) and the July 2014 OPPS quarterly update CR (Transmittal 2971, Change Request 8776, dated May 23, 2014), we recognized several new HCPCS codes for separate payment under the OPPS.</p>
          <p id="p-1104" data-page="66838">Effective April 1, 2014, we made effective four new Level II HCPCS codes and also assigned them to appropriate interim OPPS status indicators and APCs. Through the April 2014 OPPS quarterly update CR, we allowed separate payment for three of the four new Level II HCPCS codes. Specifically, as displayed in Table 15 in the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40975">79 FR 40975</a>), we provided separate payment for HCPCS codes C9021, C9739, and C9740. HCPCS code Q2052 was assigned to status indicator &#x201C;N&#x201D; to indicate the service described by this code is packaged under the OPPS.</p>
          <p id="p-1105" data-page="66838">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40974">79 FR 40974</a>), we solicited public comments on the proposed APC and status indicator assignments, where applicable, for the Level II HCPCS codes listed in Table 15 of that proposed rule (HCPCS codes C9021, C9739, C9740, and Q2052). We did not receive any public comments on the proposed APC and status indicator assignments for HCPCS codes C9021 and Q2052. Because HCPCS code Q2052 will only be billed by pharmacy suppliers, we are modifying our CY 2015 proposal to continue to assign HCPCS code Q2052 to status indicator &#x201C;N.&#x201D; Instead, for CY 2015, we are reassigning HCPCS code Q2052 from OPPS status indicator &#x201C;N&#x201D; to &#x201C;E&#x201D; (Not paid by Medicare when submitted on outpatient claims (any outpatient bill type)). We are adopting as final, without modification, the proposed APC and status indicator assignments for HCPCS code C9021 for CY 2015. We note that we received some public comments on HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740, which we address in section III.C.3.e. of this final rule with comment period.</p>

          <p id="p-1108" data-page="66838">Effective July 1, 2014, we made effective several new CPT and Level II HCPCS codes and also assigned them to appropriate interim OPPS status indicators and APCs. Through the July 2014 OPPS quarterly update CR, we allowed separate payment under the OPPS for four new Level II HCPCS codes and 17 new Category III CPT codes effective July 1, 2014. Specifically, as displayed in Table 16 in the proposed rule, we allowed separate payment for HCPCS codes C2644, C9022, C9134, and Q9970. We note that HCPCS code Q9970 replaced HCPCS code C9441 (Injection, ferric carboxymaltose, 1 mg), beginning July 1, 2014. HCPCS code C9441 was made effective January 1, 2014, but the code was deleted June 30, 2014, because it was replaced with HCPCS code Q9970. HCPCS code C9441 was granted pass-through payment status when the code was implemented on January 1, 2014. Because HCPCS code Q9970 describes the same drug as HCPCS code C9441, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40975">79 FR 40975</a>), we proposed to continue the pass-through payment status for HCPCS code Q9970, and assign the HCPCS Q-code to the same APC and status indicator as its predecessor HCPCS C-code, as shown in Table 16 of the proposed rule. Specifically, we proposed to assign HCPCS code Q9970 to APC 9441 (Inj, Ferric Carboxymaltose) and status indicator &#x201C;G.&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="p-1109" data-page="66838">In addition, the HCPCS Workgroup established HCPCS code Q9974, effective July 1, 2014, to replace HCPCS codes J2271 (Injection, morphine sulfate, 100mg) and J2275 (Injection, morphine sulfate (preservative-free sterile solution), per 10 mg). Both of these HCPCS J-codes were assigned to status indicator &#x201C;N&#x201D; (Packaged Services). As a result of the establishment of new HCPCS code Q9974 as a replacement for HCPCS codes J2271 and J2275, the payment indicator for HCPCS codes J2271 and J2275 was changed to &#x201C;E&#x201D; (Not Payable by Medicare), effective July 1, 2014. Also, because HCPCS code Q9974 describes the same services that were described by HCPCS codes J2271 and J2275, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40975">79 FR 40975</a>), we proposed to continue to assign HCPCS code Q9974 to the same status indicator as its predecessor HCPCS J-codes. Specifically, we proposed to assign HCPCS code Q9974 to status indicator &#x201C;N,&#x201D; effective July 1, 2014.<span id="page-66839" class="printed_page" data-page="66839"> </span>

This table included a complete list of the Level II HCPCS codes that were made effective July 1, 2014. The codes that were made effective July 1, 2014, did not appear in Addendum B to the proposed rule, and as a result, the proposed payment rates along with the proposed status indicators and proposed APC assignments, where applicable, for CY 2015 were provided in Table 16 of the proposed rule.</p>
          <p id="p-1111" data-page="66839">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40975">79 FR 40975</a>), we solicited public comments on the proposed status indicators and APC assignments for the HCPCS codes that were listed in Table 16 of the proposed rule. We did not receive any public comments on the proposed APC and status indicator assignments for HCPCS codes C9022, C9134, Q9970, and Q9974 for CY 2015. Therefore, we are adopting as final, without modification, the proposed APC and status indicator assignments for these four Level II HCPCS codes for CY 2015. We note that we received a public comment on HCPCS code C2644, which is addressed in section II.A.2.d.3. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <p id="p-1112" data-page="66839">The HCPCS Workgroup replaced HCPCS code C9022 with HCPCS code J1322, effective January 1, 2015. Because HCPCS code J1322 describes the same drug with the same dosage descriptor as its predecessor code, HCPCS code C9022, this drug will continue to receive pass-through payment status in CY 2015. Therefore, we are assigning HCPCS code J1322 to the same APC and status indicator as its predecessor code, HCPCS code C9022, as shown in Table 17 below.</p>
          <p id="p-1113" data-page="66839">In addition, the HCPCS Workgroup replaced HCPCS code C9134 with HCPCS code J7181, effective January 1, 2015. Because HCPCS code J7181 does not describe the same dosage descriptor as its predecessor code, HCPCS code J7181 has been assigned to a new APC. Specifically, HCPCS code C9134 had a dosage descriptor of &#x201C;10 i.u.,&#x201D; while HCPCS code J7181 has a dosage descriptor of &#x201C;i.u.&#x201D; Therefore, effective January 1, 2015, we are assigning HCPCS code J7181 to APC 1746, which is a different APC assignment than the APC assignment for HCPCS code C9134, to maintain data consistency for future rulemakings. Because the predecessor code, HCPCS code C9134, was granted pass-through payment status, HCPCS code J7181 will continue to be assigned to status indicator &#x201C;G&#x201D; for CY 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-1114" data-page="66839">We also note that the HCPCS Workgroup replaced HCPCS code Q9970 with HCPCS code J1439, effective January 1, 2015. Because HCPCS code J1439 describes the same drug with the same dosage descriptor as its predecessor code, HCPCS code Q9970, this drug will continue to receive pass-through payment status in CY 2015. Therefore, we are assigning HCPCS code J1439 to the same APC and status indicator as its predecessor code, HCPCS code Q9970, as shown in Table 17 below.</p>
          <p id="p-1115" data-page="66839">Further, the HCPCS Workgroup replaced HCPCS code Q9974 with HCPCS code J2274, effective January 1, 2015. Because HCPCS code J2274 describes the same drug with the same dosage descriptor as its predecessor code, HCPCS code Q9974, this drug will continue its packaged status indicator. Therefore, we are assigning HCPCS code J2274 to the same status indicator as its predecessor code, HCPCS code Q9974, as also shown in Table 17 below.</p>

Under the OPPS, Category I CPT vaccine codes and Category III CPT codes that are released on the AMA Web site in January are made effective in July of the same year through the July quarterly update CR, consistent with the AMA&apos;s implementation date for the codes. For the July 2014 update, there were no new Category I CPT vaccine codes.</p>

These codes were listed in Tables 15, 16, and 17 of the proposed rule. We also proposed to finalize the status indicator and APC assignments and payment rates for these codes, if applicable, in this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. Because the new Category III CPT and Level II HCPCS codes that became effective for July were not available to us in time for incorporation into the Addenda to the proposed rule, our policy is to include the codes, the proposed status indicators, proposed APCs (where applicable), and proposed payment rates (where applicable) in the preamble of the proposed rule, but not in the Addenda to the proposed rule. These codes were listed in Tables 16 and 17, respectively, of the proposed rule. We also proposed to incorporate these codes into Addendum B to this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, which is consistent with our annual OPPS update policy. The Level II HCPCS codes implemented or modified through the April 2014 OPPS update CR and displayed in Table 15 were included in Addendum B to the proposed rule (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site), where the proposed CY 2015 payment rates for these codes were also shown.</p>

We establish interim APC and status indicator assignments for these new codes for the coming year, and<span id="page-66842" class="printed_page" data-page="66842"> </span>request comments on the interim assignments in the OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. Similarly, we establish interim APC and status indicator assignments for existing CPT codes that have substantial revision to their code descriptors that necessitate a change in the current APC assignments, and request comments on the interim assignments in the OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. In both cases, we assign these new and revised codes to OPPS comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; (New code for the next calendar year or existing code with substantial revision to its code descriptor in the next calendar year as compared to current calendar year, interim APC assignment; comments will be accepted on the interim APC assignment for the new code.) in the OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. We respond to comments and finalize the APC and status indicator assignments for these CPT codes in the following year&apos;s OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Current Process for Accepting Comments on New and Revised CPT Codes for a Year</b></p>
          <p id="p-1127" data-page="66842">As described above, under the hospital OPPS, our current process for both new CPT codes and existing CPT codes with substantial revisions to the code descriptors that are released by the AMA for use beginning January 1 is to flag these codes with comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; in Addendum B to the OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period to indicate that the codes are new for the calendar year and have been assigned interim APCs and status indicators, and that we are accepting public comments on the interim APC and status indicator assignments. We address public comments received and finalize the APC and status indicator assignments for the codes in the next year&apos;s OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. For example, the new CPT codes that were effective January 1, 2014, were assigned to comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; in Addendum B to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. We respond to public comments received on the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period and finalize the APC and status indicator assignments for these codes in this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. We include the final APC and status indicator assignments for these codes in Addendum B to this final rule with comment period (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site).</p>
          <p id="p-1128" data-page="66842">Many stakeholders have expressed concern with the process we use to recognize new and revised CPT codes. They believe that CMS should publish proposed APC and status indicator assignments for the new and revised CPT codes that will be effective January 1 in the OPPS/ASC proposed rule for that calendar year, and request public comments prior to finalizing the assignments. Further, the stakeholders believe that seeking public input on the APC and status indicator assignments for these new and revised codes would assist CMS in assigning the CPT codes to appropriate APCs. Similar concerns have been expressed regarding our process for assigning interim payment values for revalued, and new and revised codes, under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). We refer readers to the CY 2015 MPFS proposed rule for a detailed discussion of this issue as it relates to the MPFS (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40359">79 FR 40359</a> through 40364).</p>
          <p id="p-1129" data-page="66842">Like the MPFS, the OPPS and the ASC payment system rely principally upon the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT&#xAE;) coding system maintained by the AMA to identify specific services for billing and payment purposes. CPT is the standard code set adopted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) for outpatient services. The AMA CPT Editorial Panel&apos;s coding cycle occurs concurrently with our calendar year rulemaking cycle for the OPPS and the ASC payment system. However, the OPPS/ASC proposed rules are published prior to the publication of the CPT codes that are made public in the Fall with a January 1 effective date, and we are currently unable to include these codes in the OPPS/ASC proposed rules. Consequently, we establish in the final rule with comment period interim APC and status indicator assignments for new and revised CPT codes that have an effective date of January 1, and we make payment based on those interim designations for one year, while accepting public comments on the final rule with comment period. We then respond to those public comments received and make final APC and status indicator assignments in the next year&apos;s final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Modification of Process for New and Revised CPT Codes That Are Effective January 1</b></p>
          <p id="p-1130" data-page="66842">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40977">79 FR 40977</a> through 40979), we proposed to make changes in the process we use to establish APC assignments and status indicators for new and revised codes. We proposed that, for new and revised CPT codes that we receive from the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel too late for inclusion in the proposed rule for a year, we would delay adoption of the new and revised codes for that year, and instead, adopt coding policies and payment rates that conform, to the extent possible, to the policies and payment rates in place for the previous year. We proposed to adopt these conforming coding and payment policies on an interim basis pending the result of our specific proposals for status indicator and APC assignments for these new and revised codes through notice and comment rulemaking in the OPPS/ASC proposed rule for the following year. Because the changes in CPT codes are effective on January 1 of each year, and CMS would not have established status indicator or APC assignments for these new or revised codes, it would not be practicable for Medicare to use those CPT codes. In this circumstance, we proposed to create HCPCS G-codes to describe the predecessor codes for any codes that were revised or deleted as part of the annual CPT coding changes, but that we did not receive in time to include proposed APC and status indicator assignments in the proposed rule. However, if certain CPT codes are revised in a manner that would not affect the cost of inputs (for example, a minor change to CPT code descriptors), we would use these revised codes and continue to assign those codes to their current APC. For example, under this proposed process, if a single CPT code was separated into two codes and we did not receive those codes until May 2015, we would assign each of those CPT codes to status indicator &#x201C;B&#x201D; in the final rule with comment period, to indicate that an alternate code is recognized under the OPPS. Hospitals could not use those two new CPT codes to bill Medicare for outpatient services the first year after the CPT effective date of the codes. Instead, we would create a HCPCS G-code with the same description as the single predecessor CPT code, and continue to use the same APC and status indicator assignment for the new G-code during the year. We would propose APC and status indicator assignments for the two new CPT codes during rulemaking in CY 2016, accept and respond to public comments on the proposed assignments, and establish final APC and status indicator assignments for the codes in the final rule for payment beginning in CY 2017.</p>

          <p id="p-1131" data-page="66842">For new codes that describe wholly new services, as opposed to new or revised codes that describe services for which APC and status indicator assignments are already established, we would make every effort to work with the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel to ensure that we received the codes in time to propose payment rates in the proposed rule. However, if we do not<span id="page-66843" class="printed_page" data-page="66843"> </span>receive the code for a wholly new service in time to include proposed APC and status indicator assignments in the proposed rule for a year, we would need to establish interim APC and status indicator assignments for the initial year because there would be no predecessor code we could use as a reference to establish a G-code in order to continue current payment policies for such a service. We proposed to continue to establish the initial APC and status indicator assignments for these wholly new services as interim final assignments, and to follow our current process to solicit and respond to public comments and finalize the APC and status indicator assignments in the subsequent year.</p>
          <p id="p-1132" data-page="66843">We recognize that the use of HCPCS G-codes may place an administrative burden on those providers that bill for services under the OPPS and the ASC payment system. However, the proposed use of G-codes would permit us to propose and accept public comment on the APC and status indicator assignments for the vast majority of new and revised codes before they take effect. We are hopeful that the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel ultimately will be able to adjust its timelines and processes so that most, if not all, of the annual coding changes can be addressed in the proposed rule before the new and revised CPT codes take effect on January 1. If the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Committee can make adjustments to its schedule, we would not need to use G-codes as described above for the purpose of maintaining outdated coding and APC and status indicator assignments for a year until we can include proposed APC and status indicator assignments for the new and revised codes in a proposed rule. We proposed to implement the revised CMS process for establishing APC and status indicator assignments for new and revised codes for CY 2016. However, we indicated in the proposed rule that we would consider alternative implementation dates if that would allow time for the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel to adjust its schedule in order to avoid the necessity to use numerous HCPCS G-codes.</p>
          <p id="p-1133" data-page="66843">In summary, in conjunction with the proposals presented in the CY 2015 MPFS proposed rule to revise the process used to address new, revised, and potentially misvalued codes under the MPFS, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40977">79 FR 40977</a> through 40979), we proposed to include in the OPPS/ASC proposed rule the proposed APC and status indicator assignments for the vast majority of new and revised CPT codes before they are used for payment purposes under the OPPS and ASC payment system. We would address new and revised CPT codes for the upcoming year that are available in time for the proposed rule by proposing APC and status indicator assignments for the codes. Otherwise, we will delay adoption of the new and revised codes for a year while using methods (including creating G-codes that describe the predecessor codes) to maintain the existing APC and status indicator assignments until the following year when we would include proposed assignments for the new and revised codes in the proposed rule. We proposed to follow this revised process except in the case of a new CPT code that describes a wholly new service (such as a new technology or new surgical procedure) that has not previously been addressed under the OPPS. For codes that describe wholly new services for which we do not receive timely information from the AMA, we proposed to establish interim APC and status indicator assignments in the OPPS/ASC final rules with comment period, as is our current process. The proposed revised process would eliminate our current practice of assigning interim APC and status indicators for the vast majority of new and revised CPT codes that take effect on January 1 each year. We invited public comments on this proposal. We indicated in the proposed rule that we were specifically interested in receiving public comments on the following topics:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1134" data-page="66843"> Is this proposal preferable to the present process? Are there other alternatives?</li>
          <li id="p-1135" data-page="66843"> If we were to implement this proposal, is it better to move forward with the changes or is more time needed to make the transition and, therefore, implementation should be delayed beyond CY 2016?</li>
          <li id="p-1136" data-page="66843"> Are there alternatives other than the use of HCPCS G-codes that would allow us to address the annual CPT code changes through notice and comment rather than interim final rulemaking?</li>
          <li id="p-1137" data-page="66843"> Is the process we have proposed for wholly new services appropriate? How should we define new services?</li>
          <li id="p-1138" data-page="66843"> Are there any classes of services, other than new services, that should remain on an interim final schedule?</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-1139" data-page="66843">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> The majority of the commenters supported the proposal to modify the current process of recognizing new and revised CPT codes because it would provide an opportunity for the public to comment on specific APC and status indicator assignments prior to those assignments being finalized. However, several commenters disagreed with our proposed implementation date of CY 2016 and requested that CMS work with the AMA to determine an appropriate implementation date. Other commenters suggested that CMS finalize the proposal but urged CMS to work with the AMA on an appropriate timeline that considers the AMA&apos;s CPT and RUC (Specialty Society Relative Value Update Committee) meeting dates as well as CMS&apos; OPPS and MPFS regulation schedule. The AMA supported the proposal but requested that CMS finalize the proposal for CY 2017 rather than CY 2016 because the CPT codes for the CY 2016 update are almost complete.</p>
          <p id="p-1140" data-page="66843">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate the commenters&apos; support for our proposal. We believe that publishing our proposed status indicator and APC assignments for the new and revised CPT codes in the proposed rule would alleviate some concerns expressed by stakeholders in the past that some of our interim APC assignments were not appropriate, and that the APC assignment process could be improved if we had the benefit of public comments before adopting final APC and status indicator assignments for new and revised codes. This new process of proposing and requesting public comments before finalizing the APC and status indicator assignments for new and revised codes allows both CMS and stakeholders the benefit of public notice and comment prior to the use of the new and revised codes for payment purposes. When we receive information on the new and revised codes from the AMA in time to include proposals for new and revised codes in the proposed rule before the codes are effective the following January 1, the revised process allows public notice and comment before finalizing APC and status indicator assignments for the codes during the calendar year before the CPT codes become effective. In addition, this new process eliminates the need to make interim APC and status indicator assignments for new and revised CPT codes, which has been unpopular among some providers because the interim assignments are used for payment for a year before we address public comments and make any appropriate changes to an APC or status indicator assignment in the subsequent year&apos;s final rule.</p>

          <p id="p-1141" data-page="66843">Although the AMA and several commenters requested that we modify our proposal by finalizing this new process for the CY 2017 OPPS update, we disagree with this recommendation. We believe the new process that permits an opportunity for public comment on<span id="page-66844" class="printed_page" data-page="66844"> </span>proposed APC and status indicator assignments for the vast majority of new and revised codes before they are finalized and used for payment purposes will be beneficial to CMS and to hospitals and other stakeholders, and we see no reason to delay implementation of this policy change. Therefore, beginning with the CY 2016 OPPS update, we will publish proposed APC and status indicator assignments for any new and revised CPT codes for January 1, 2016 that are publicly released by the AMA in time for us to consider them for inclusion in the OPPS/ASC proposed rule. After review of the public comments received on the proposed rule, we will finalize the status indicator and APC assignments for those new and revised CPT codes in the CY 2016 OPPS/ASC final rule. Because the APC assignments would be final, we would no longer request comments in the OPPS/ASC final rules for these new and revised CPT codes that are included in the proposed rule. For any new and revised codes released too late for us to consider them for inclusion in the CY 2016 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we will create HCPCS G-codes that reflect the same description(s), and APC and status indicator assignments, as their predecessor codes. These HCPCS G-codes will be used during CY 2016, and then we will include proposals for the corresponding new and revised codes and APC and status indicator assignments in the CY 2017 OPPS/ASC proposed rule.</p>
          <p id="p-1142" data-page="66844">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Most commenters opposed the use of temporary HCPCS G-codes and requested that CMS not implement the HCPCS G-code process if it finalizes the proposal to change to process for new and revised CPT codes. The commenters recommended not establishing temporary HCPCS G-codes because these codes would be extremely burdensome for providers to use. The commenters stated that establishing HCPCS G-codes for services or procedures that are already described by existing CPT codes would be too confusing for hospitals, physicians, and other third party insurers to accurately claim costs for these procedures, and that using two different sets of codes for the same procedure or service could result in erroneous claims.</p>
          <p id="p-1143" data-page="66844">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As described above, we plan to publish the new and revised CPT codes that are publicly available and provided to us in time for evaluation in the CY 2016 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. Specifically, in the CY 2016 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we expect to publish new and revised CPT codes that would be effective January 1, 2016, with the proposed status indicator and APC assignments, and request public comments on these proposed assignments as long as we receive them in time for inclusion in the proposed rule. We would finalize the status indicator and APC assignments for these new and revised CPT codes in the CY 2016 OPPS/ASC final rule.</p>
          <p id="p-1144" data-page="66844">However, for those new and revised CPT codes that are not publicly available in time for the OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we will create HCPCS G-codes that mirror the predecessor CPT codes and retain the current APC and status indicator assignments for a year until we can include proposed status indicator and APC assignments in the following year&apos;s proposed rule. These HCPCS G-codes will be assigned to comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; to indicate that the codes are new and open for comment for 60 days after display of the OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. This is consistent with our current policy of seeking public comments on new CPT and Level II HCPCS codes with interim APC and status indicator assignments that were not previously published in the proposed rule. For new and revised codes, we recognize that there is a trade-off between the benefit of considering public comments on the proposed APC and status indicator assignments before they take effect and the potential confusion caused by the use of HCPCS G-codes. We anticipate that the use of HCPCS G-codes will be largely a temporary solution or may not be necessary in the OPPS, and we expect to work closely with the AMA to minimize the need for them. We note that, under the MPFS, we generally do not develop values for new and revised CPT codes until we receive recommendations provided by the AMA&apos;s RUC. In contrast, under the OPPS, we use only the publicly available new and revised CPT codes and their descriptors to develop APC and status indicator assignments. As such, we anticipate that the need to use HCPCS G-codes under the OPPS will be less frequent than under the MPFS.</p>
          <p id="p-1145" data-page="66844">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal. For the new and revised CPT codes that we receive timely from the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel, we are finalizing our proposal to include these codes that would be effective January 1 in the OPPS/ASC proposed rules, along with proposed APC and status indicator assignments for them, and to finalize the APC and status indicator assignments in the OPPS/ASC final rules beginning with the CY 2016 OPPS update. For those new and revised CPT codes that we receive too late for inclusion in the OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we are finalizing our proposal to create and use HCPCS G-codes that mirror the predecessor CPT codes and retain the current APC and status indicator assignments for a year until we can propose APC and status indicator assignments in the following year&apos;s rulemaking cycle. We note that even if we find that we need to create HCPCS G-codes in place of certain CPT codes for the MPFS proposed rule, we do not anticipate that these HCPCS G-codes will always be necessary for OPPS purposes. We will make every effort to include proposed APC and status indicator assignments for all new and revised CPT codes that the AMA makes publicly available in time for us to include them in the proposed rule, and to avoid the resort to HCPCS G-codes and the resulting delay in utilization of the most current CPT codes. We also are finalizing our proposal to make interim APC and status indicator assignments for CPT codes that are not available in time for the proposed rule and that describe wholly new services (such as new technologies or new surgical procedures), solicit public comments, and finalize the specific APC and status indicator assignments for those codes in the following year&apos;s final rule.</p>

<h4><a name="94"></a>B. OPPS Changes&#x2014;Variations Within APCs</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Background</b></p>

          <p id="p-1146" data-page="66844">Section 1833(t)(2)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to develop a classification system for covered hospital outpatient department services. Section 1833(t)(2)(B) of the Act provides that the Secretary may establish groups of covered OPD services within this classification system, so that services classified within each group are comparable clinically and with respect to the use of resources. In accordance with these provisions, we developed a grouping classification system, referred to as Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APCs), as set forth in &#xA7; 419.31 of the regulations. We use Level I and Level II HCPCS codes to identify and group the services within each APC. The APCs are organized such that each group is homogeneous both clinically and in terms of resource use. Using this classification system, we have established distinct groups of similar services. We also have developed separate APC groups for certain medical devices, drugs, biologicals, therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, and brachytherapy devices that are not<span id="page-66845" class="printed_page" data-page="66845"> </span>packaged into the payment for the procedure.</p>
          <p id="p-1147" data-page="66845">We have packaged into the payment for each procedure or service within an APC group the costs associated with those items and services that are typically ancillary and supportive to a primary diagnostic or therapeutic modality and, in those cases, are an integral part of the primary service they support. Therefore, we do not make separate payment for these packaged items or services. In general, packaged items and services include, but are not limited to the items and services listed in &#xA7; 419.2(b) of the regulations. A further discussion of packaged services is included in section II.A.3. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <p id="p-1148" data-page="66845">In CY 2008, we implemented composite APCs to provide a single payment for groups of services that are typically performed together during a single clinical encounter and that result in the provision of a complete service (<a href="/citation/72-FR-66650">72 FR 66650</a> through 66652). For CY 2014, we provided composite APC payments for nine categories of services:</p>
          
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1149" data-page="66845"> Mental Health Services Composite (APC 0034)</li>
          <li id="p-1150" data-page="66845"> Cardiac Electrophysiologic Evaluation and Ablation Composite (APC 8000)</li>
          <li id="p-1151" data-page="66845"> Low Dose Rate (LDR) Prostate Brachytherapy Composite (APC 8001)</li>
          <li id="p-1152" data-page="66845"> Ultrasound Composite (APC 8004)</li>
          <li id="p-1153" data-page="66845"> CT and CTA without Contrast Composite (APC 8005)</li>
          <li id="p-1154" data-page="66845"> CT and CTA with Contrast Composite (APC 8006)</li>
          <li id="p-1155" data-page="66845"> MRI and MRA without Contrast Composite (APC 8007)</li>
          <li id="p-1156" data-page="66845"> MRI and MRA with Contrast Composite (APC 8008)</li>
          <li id="p-1157" data-page="66845"> Extended Assessment &amp; Management Composite (APC 8009)</li>
</ul>
          
          <p id="p-1158" data-page="66845">A further discussion of composite APCs is included in section II.A.2.f. of this final rule with comment period. We note that, as a consequence of the new comprehensive APC policy, APC 8000 (Cardiac Electrophysiologic Evaluation and Ablation Composite) is being deleted.</p>
          <p id="p-1159" data-page="66845">Under the OPPS, we generally pay for hospital outpatient services on a rate-per-service basis, where the service may be reported with one or more HCPCS codes. Payment varies according to the APC group to which the independent service or combination of services is assigned. Each APC relative payment weight represents the hospital cost of the services included in that APC, relative to the hospital cost of the services included in APC 0634 (Hospital Clinic Visits). The APC relative payment weights are scaled to APC 0634 because it is the hospital clinic visit APC and clinic visits are among the most frequently furnished services in the hospital outpatient setting.</p>
          <p id="p-1160" data-page="66845">Section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to review, no less than annually, and revise the APC groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments to take into account changes in medical practice, changes in technology, the addition of new services, new cost data, and other relevant information and factors. Section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act also requires the Secretary to consult with an expert outside advisory panel composed of an appropriate selection of representatives of providers to review (and advise the Secretary concerning) the clinical integrity of the APC groups and the relative payment weights (the Panel recommendations for specific services for the CY 2015 OPPS and our responses to them are discussed in the relevant specific sections throughout this final rule with comment period).</p>
          <p id="p-1161" data-page="66845">Finally, section 1833(t)(2) of the Act provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the items and services within an APC group cannot be considered comparable with respect to the use of resources if the highest cost for an item or service in the group is more than 2 times greater than the lowest cost for an item or service within the same group (referred to as the &#x201C;2 times rule&#x201D;). The statute authorizes the Secretary to make exceptions to the 2 times rule in unusual cases, such as low-volume items and services (but the Secretary may not make such an exception in the case of a drug or biological that has been designated as an orphan drug under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act).</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Application of the 2 Times Rule</b></p>
          <p id="p-1162" data-page="66845">In accordance with section 1833(t)(2) of the Act and &#xA7; 419.31 of the regulations, we annually review the items and services within an APC group to determine, with respect to comparability of the use of resources, if the cost of the highest cost item or service within an APC group is more than 2 times greater than the cost of the lowest cost item or service within that same group. In making this determination, we consider only those HCPCS codes that are significant based on the number of claims. We note that, for purposes of identifying significant procedure codes for examination under the 2 times rule, we consider procedure codes that have more than 1,000 single major claims or procedure codes that have both greater than 99 single major claims and contribute at least 2 percent of the single major claims used to establish the APC cost to be significant (<a href="/citation/75-FR-71832">75 FR 71832</a>). This longstanding definition of when a procedure code is significant for purposes of the 2 times rule was selected because we believe that a subset of 1,000 claims (or less than 1,000 claims) is negligible within the set of approximately 100 million single procedure or single session claims we use for establishing costs. Similarly, a procedure code for which there are fewer than 99 single bills and which comprises less than 2 percent of the single major claims within an APC will have a negligible impact on the APC cost. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40981">79 FR 40981</a>), for CY 2015, we proposed to make exceptions to this limit on the variation of costs within each APC group in unusual cases, such as low-volume items and services.</p>

          <p id="p-1163" data-page="66845">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we identified the APCs with violations of the 2 times rule for CY 2015 (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40980">79 FR 40980</a>). Therefore, we proposed changes to the procedure codes assigned to these APCs in Addendum B to the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. We noted that Addendum B did not appear in the printed version of the <span class="E-04">Federal Register</span> as part of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. Rather, it was published and made available via the Internet on the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html</a></i>. In these cases, to eliminate a violation of the 2 times rule or to improve clinical and resource homogeneity, we proposed to reassign these procedure codes to new APCs that contain services that are similar with regard to both their clinical and resource characteristics. In many cases, the proposed procedure code reassignments and associated APC reconfigurations for CY 2015 included in the proposed rule are related to changes in costs of services that were observed in the CY 2013 claims data newly available for CY 2015 ratesetting. We also proposed changes to the status indicators for some procedure codes that were not specifically and separately discussed in the proposed rule. In these cases, we proposed to change the status indicators for these procedure codes because we believe that another status indicator would more accurately describe their payment status from an OPPS perspective based on the policies that we proposed for CY 2015. In addition, we proposed to rename existing APCs or create new clinical APCs to complement the proposed procedure code reassignments. Addendum B to the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC<span id="page-66846" class="printed_page" data-page="66846"> </span>proposed rule identified with a comment indicator &#x201C;CH&#x201D; those procedure codes for which we proposed a change to the APC assignment or status indicator, or both, that were initially assigned in the April 2014 Addendum B Update (available via the Internet on the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html</a></i>). In contrast, Addendum B to this final rule with comment period (available via the Internet on the CMS Web site) identifies with the &#x201C;CH&#x201D; comment indicator the final CY 2015 changes compared to the HCPCS codes&apos; status as reflected in the October 2014 Addendum B update.</p>
          <br><p><b>3. Exceptions to the 2 Times Rule</b></p>
          <p id="p-1164" data-page="66846">As discussed earlier, we may make exceptions to the 2 times rule limit on the variation of costs within each APC group in unusual cases such as low-volume items and services. Taking into account the APC changes that we proposed for CY 2015, we reviewed all of the APCs to determine which APCs would not meet the requirements of the 2 times rule. We used the following criteria to evaluate whether to propose exceptions to the 2 times rule for affected APCs:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1165" data-page="66846"> Resource homogeneity;</li>
          <li id="p-1166" data-page="66846"> Clinical homogeneity;</li>
          <li id="p-1167" data-page="66846"> Hospital outpatient setting utilization;</li>
          <li id="p-1168" data-page="66846"> Frequency of service (volume); and</li>
          <li id="p-1169" data-page="66846"> Opportunity for upcoding and code fragments.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-1170" data-page="66846">Based on the CY 2013 claims data available for the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we found 9 APCs with violations of the 2 times rule. We applied the criteria as described above to identify the APCs that we proposed to make exceptions for under the 2 times rule for CY 2015, and identified 9 APCs that met the criteria for an exception to the 2 times rule based on the CY 2013 claims data available for the proposed rule. We did not include in that determination those APCs where a 2 times rule violation was not a relevant concept, such as APC 0375 (Ancillary Outpatient Services when Patient Expires), which has an APC cost set based on multiple procedure claims. Therefore, we only identified those APCs, including those with criteria-based costs, such as device-dependent APCs, with violations of the 2 times rule. For a detailed discussion of these criteria, we refer readers to the April 7, 2000 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/65-FR-18457">65 FR 18457</a> and 18458).</p>
          <p id="p-1171" data-page="66846">We note that, for cases in which a recommendation by the Panel appears to result in or allow a violation of the 2 times rule, we generally accept the Panel&apos;s recommendation because those recommendations are based on explicit consideration (that is, a review of the latest OPPS claims data and group discussion of the issue) of resource use, clinical homogeneity, site of service, and the quality of the claims data used to determine the APC payment rates.</p>
          <p id="p-1172" data-page="66846">Table 18 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40981">79 FR 40981</a>) listed the 9 APCs that we proposed to make exceptions for under the 2 times rule for CY 2015 based on the criteria cited above and claims data submitted between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, and processed on or before December 31, 2013. For the final rule with comment period, we stated that we intend to use claims data for dates of service between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, that were processed on or before June 30, 2014, and updated CCRs, if available. Therefore, after considering the public comments we received on the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule and making changes to APC assignments based on those comments, we analyzed the CY 2013 claims data used for this final rule with comment period to identify the APCs with violations of the 2 times rule. Based on the final CY 2013 claims data, we found 12 APCs with violations of the 2 times rule for this final rule with comment period, which is 3 more APCs that violated the 2 times rule compared to those indicated in the proposed rule. We applied the criteria as described earlier to identify the APCs that are exceptions to the 2 times rule for CY 2015, and identified three new APCs that meet the criteria for exception to the 2 times rule for this final rule with comment period, but that did not meet the criteria using proposed rule claims data. Specifically, we found that the following three new APCs violated the 2 times rule:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1173" data-page="66846"> APC 0095 (Cardiac Rehabilitation);</li>
          <li id="p-1174" data-page="66846"> APC 0388 (Discography); and</li>
          <li id="p-1175" data-page="66846"> APC 0420 (Level III Minor Procedures).</li>
</ul>

          <p id="p-1176" data-page="66846">After consideration of the public comments we received and our review of the CY 2013 costs from hospital claims and cost report data available for this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposals with some modifications. Specifically, we are finalizing our proposal to except 7 of the 9 proposed APCs from the 2 times rule for CY 2015: APCs 0057, 0066, 0330, 0433, 0450, 0634, and 0661. In contrast, we are not finalizing our proposal to except 2 of the 9 proposed APCs from the 2 times rule: APC 0012 (Level I Debridement &amp; Destruction) and APC 0015 (Level II Debridement &amp; Destruction). Our data analysis for this final rule with comment period revealed that these two APCs no longer violate the 2 times rule. Table 19 below lists 10 APCs that we are excepting from the 2 times rule for CY 2015 based on the criteria above and a review of updated claims data. We note that, for cases in which a recommendation by the HOP Panel appears to result in or allow a violation of the 2 times rule, we generally accept the Panel&apos;s recommendation because those recommendations are based on explicit consideration of resource use, clinical homogeneity, site of service, and the quality of the claims data used to determine the APC payment rates. The geometric mean costs for hospital outpatient services for these and all other APCs that were used in the development of this final rule with comment period can be found on the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/Hospital-Outpatient-Regulations-and-Notices.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/Hospital-Outpatient-Regulations-and-Notices.html</a>.</i>

<h4><a name="98"></a>C. OPPS APC-Specific Policies</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Cardiovascular and Vascular Services: Cardiac Telemetry (APC 0213)</b></p>

          <p id="p-1178" data-page="66846">For CY 2015, we proposed to reassign CPT code 93229 (External mobile cardiovascular telemetry with electrocardiographic recording, concurrent computerized real time data analysis and greater than 24 hours of accessible ECG data storage (retrievable with query) with ECG triggered and patient selected events transmitted to a remote attended surveillance center for up to 30 days; technical support for connection and patient instructions for use, attended surveillance, analysis and<span id="page-66847" class="printed_page" data-page="66847"> </span>transmission of daily and emergent data reports as prescribed by a physician or other qualified health care professional) from APC 0209 (Level II Extended EEG, Sleep, and Cardiovascular Studies), with a proposed rule payment rate of approximately $239 to APC 0213 (Level I Extended EEG, Sleep, and Cardiovascular Studies), with a proposed payment rate of approximately $175.</p>
          <p id="p-1179" data-page="66847">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter opposed CMS&apos; proposal to reassign CPT code 93229 to APC 0213 and stated that the hospital costs used to set the CY 2015 proposed payment rate is based on faulty claims data, which include miscoded claims reporting the service submitted by hospitals. The commenter indicated that based on its internal analysis of the CY 2013 hospital claims data, which were used as the basis for the CY 2015 proposed APC reassignment, several hospitals reported costs of under $100 for the procedure described by CPT code 93229. The commenter stated that the service described by CPT code 93229 involves the use of sophisticated technology requiring attended surveillance on a 24-hour, 7 days a week basis by a technician for up to 30 days. According to the commenter, this particular service requires resources that are greater than $100. The commenter further explained that the service described by CPT code 93229 requires up to 30 days of electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring through an external device worn by the patient at home that captures, stores, and transmits ECG data in real-time through wireless technology to a receiving or monitoring center (the hospital outpatient facility). These data are then reviewed by certified cardiac technicians and the ordering physician is provided with daily reports. The commenter added that this procedure is performed primarily (approximately 90 percent of the time) by independent diagnostic testing facilities (IDTFs) and infrequently performed by hospitals, typically under arrangements with IDTFs. The commenter believed that the CY 2015 proposed payment rate of approximately $175 for APC 0213 is significantly lower than the CY 2014 MPFS payment rate of $669. The commenter stated that the actual cost of providing the service is approximately $795. Therefore, the commenter recommended that CMS either reassign CPT code 93229 to APC 0435 (Level III Extended EEG, Sleep, and Cardiovascular Studies), which has a proposed payment rate of approximately $853, or establish a new APC for outpatient cardiac telemetry services that accurately reflects the costs associated with providing this service.</p>
          <p id="p-1180" data-page="66847">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> CPT code 93229 became effective January 1, 2009. We believe that 5 years is sufficient time to understand what procedure CPT code 93229 describes and how to appropriately report this service on hospital claims. Based on our analysis of the CY 2013 hospital outpatient claims data used for this final rule with comment period, we are unable to determine whether hospitals are miscoding the claims reporting this service. For all APCs whose payment rates are based upon relative payment weights, we note that the quality and accuracy of reported units and charges influence the geometric mean costs that are the basis for our payment rates, especially the geometric mean costs for low volume items and services. Beyond our standard OPPS trimming methodology (described in section II.A.2. of this final rule with comment period) that we apply to those claims that have passed various types of claims processing edits, it is not our general policy to determine the accuracy of hospital coding and charging practices for the purposes of ratesetting (<a href="/citation/75-FR-71838">75 FR 71838</a>). We rely on hospitals to accurately report all of the services provided to beneficiaries using the established HCPCS and CPT codes that appropriately describe the procedures performed in accordance with their code descriptors and the CPT Editorial Panel&apos;s and CMS&apos; instructions, as applicable, and to include these charges and costs on their Medicare hospital cost report appropriately. In addition, we do not specify the methodologies that hospitals must use to set charges for this or any other service.</p>
          <p id="p-1181" data-page="66847">We recognize that the MPFS pays separately for CPT code 93229. However, the MPFS and the OPPS are very different payment systems. Each system is established under a different set of statutory and regulatory principles, and the policies established under the MPFS do not necessarily affect the payment policies under the OPPS. Moreover, we do not agree with the commenter that CPT code 93229 should be reassigned to APC 0435. Based on the claims data available for this final rule with comment period, we believe that APC 0213 is the most appropriate APC to reassign CPT code 93229 based on the clinical homogeneity and resource costs in relation to the other procedures assigned to this APC. Our analysis of the latest hospital outpatient CY 2013 claims data shows a final geometric mean cost of approximately $105 for CPT code 93229 based on 3,505 single claims (out of 3,579 total claims), which is not inconsistent with the geometric mean cost of approximately $183 for APC 0213, which is the lowest cost APC in the extended EEG, sleep, and cardiovascular studies series of APCs.</p>
          <p id="p-1182" data-page="66847">In response to the commenter&apos;s concern regarding miscoding of hospital claims reporting the service described by CPT code 93229, we remind hospitals that CPT code 93229 is not the appropriate procedure code to use to report Holter monitoring (CPT codes 93224 through 93227), or event monitoring (CPT codes 93268 through 93278) procedures. CPT code 93229 should be used to report continuous outpatient cardiovascular monitoring that includes up to 30 consecutive days of real-time cardiac monitoring. In particular, the 2014 CPT Code Book describes the procedure described by CPT code 93229 as a mobile cardiovascular telemetry service and defines it as:</p>
          <p id="p-1183" data-page="66847">&#x201C;Mobile cardiovascular telemetry (MCT): Continuously records the electrocardiographic rhythm from external electrodes placed on the patient&apos;s body. Segments of the ECG data are automatically (without patient intervention) transmitted to a remote surveillance location by cellular or landline telephone signal. The segments of the rhythm, selected for transmission, are triggered automatically (MCT device algorithm) by rapid and slow heart rates or by the patient during a symptomatic episode. There is continuous real time data analysis by preprogrammed algorithms in the device and attended surveillance of the transmitted rhythm segments by a surveillance center technician to evaluate any arrhythmias and to determine signal quality. The surveillance center technician reviews the data and notifies the physician or other qualified health care professional depending on the prescribed criteria&#x201D; (2014 CPT Professional Edition; page 549).</p>
          <p id="p-1184" data-page="66847">We expect that hospitals would only report CPT code 93229 on hospital claims for providing the mobile telemetry service that is described above.</p>

          <p id="p-1185" data-page="66847">In summary, after consideration of the public comment we received, we are finalizing our CY 2015 proposal, without modification, to reassign CPT code 93229 to APC 0213 for CY 2015. Consistent with our policy of reviewing APC assignments annually, we will reevaluate the cost of CPT code 93229 and its APC assignment for the CY 2016 rulemaking.<span id="page-66848" class="printed_page" data-page="66848"> </span>

In response to the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, the same commenters supported CMS&apos; proposal to reassign CPT codes 43211 and 43254 to APC 0419 for the CY 2015 OPPS update, and applauded CMS for considering the suggestions made in response to the commenters&apos; concerns. One commenter requested that CMS consider reassigning CPT codes 43211 and 43254 from APC 0141 to APC 0422 (Level III Upper GI Procedures) instead of from APC 0141 to APC 0419 as proposed. Based on an analysis of the CY 2013 OPPS claims data performed by the commenter, the commenter believed that the geometric mean costs associated with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) procedures are more closely aligned with the geometric mean cost of APC 0422 than APC 0419.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> EMR CPT codes 43211 and 43254 became effective January 1, 2014. As with all new codes, our policy has been to assign the service to an APC based on input from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, a review of the clinical similarity of the service in comparison to existing procedures; input from CMS medical advisors; information from interested specialty societies; and a review of all other information available to us. Based on the complexity of these procedures and input from our medical advisors, we believe that APC 0419 appropriately reflects the clinical homogeneity and resource costs associated with performing EMR procedures. Therefore, after consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our CY 2015 proposal, without modification, to reassign CPT codes 43211 and 43254 from APC 0141 to APC 0419 for the CY 2015 OPPS update.

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Based on our analysis of the latest hospital outpatient claims data used for this final rule with comment period, we agree with the commenters that a more appropriate APC reassignment is necessary for CPT code 43240. However, we believe that the most appropriate APC reassignment is APC 0422 (Level III Upper GI Procedures) rather than APC 0384. Our claims data show a geometric mean cost of approximately $1,574 for CPT code 43240 based on 44 single claims (out of 142 total claims), which is more comparable to the geometric mean cost of approximately $1,987 for APC 0422 than to the geometric mean cost of approximately $3,294 for APC 0384. Therefore, after consideration of the public comments we received, we are modifying our proposal regarding the APC reassignment of CPT code 43240.

The commenters noted that APC 0142 includes other capsule-based procedures that are clinically similar to the procedure described by CPT code 91035, such as the procedure described by CPT code 91112 (Gastrointestinal transit and pressure measurement, stomach through colon, wireless capsule, with interpretation and report). The commenters further explained that the procedures described by CPT codes 91035 and 91112 both involve the use of a capsule to collect pH and other data from the patient&apos;s gastrointestinal tract over a period of several days.</p>

Our claims data show a geometric mean cost of approximately $466 for CPT code 91035 based on 1,272 single claims (out of 5,099 total claims), while claims data for CPT code 91112 show a geometric mean cost of approximately $774 based on 353 single claims (out of 412 total claims). The geometric mean cost of APC 0361 is approximately $341 and the geometric mean cost of APC 0142 is approximately $884, which is almost twice the geometric cost of CPT code 91035. In addition, assigning CPT code 91035 to APC 0142 would create a violation of the 2 times rule within APC 0142 because the geometric mean cost of the highest cost significant procedure assigned to APC 0142 (CPT code 44361, with a geometric mean cost of approximately $1,019) is 2.2 times the geometric mean cost of CPT code 91035. Therefore, APC 0142 would not be an appropriate assignment for CPT code 91035. We are finalizing our CY 2015 proposal to continue to assign CPT code 91035 to APC 0361.</p>

The commenters believed that the procedure described by CPT code 0355T is similar to the procedures described by existing GI capsule endoscopy CPT codes 91110 (Gastrointestinal tract imaging, intraluminal (eg, capsule endoscopy), esophagus through ileum, with interpretation and report), 91111 (Gastrointestinal tract imaging, intraluminal (eg, capsule endoscopy), esophagus with interpretation and report), and 91112 (Gastrointestinal transit and pressure measurement, stomach through colon, wireless capsule, with interpretation and report), which are all assigned to APC 0142.</p>

With respect to these three APCs, based on claims data available for the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, only APC 0193 showed a violation of the 2 times rule. We note that, under the OPPS, we may make exceptions to the 2 times rule based on the variation of costs within each APC group in unusual cases such as low-volume items and services. In the case of APC 0193, we believed that it was necessary to make an exception to the 2 times rule for the CY 2014 OPPS update because this APC sufficiently reflected the clinical and resource coherence of the Level V female reproductive procedures.</p>

Specifically, one presenter expressed concern regarding the reassignment of the female reproductive procedures within existing APCs 0192 (Level IV Female Reproductive Procedures), 0193 (Level V Female Reproductive Procedures), and 0195 (Level VI Female Reproductive Procedures) that became effective with the CY 2014 OPPS update. The presenter stated that the proposed changes would compromise beneficiary access to pelvic floor repair procedures, and urged the Panel to request that CMS reconsider its packaging policy for the procedures assigned to APCs 0193 and 0195 and allow stakeholders the opportunity to work with CMS to appropriately reassign these procedures to accurately account for the clinical complexity associated with providing these services. In addition, the presenter requested that CMS delay the conversion of existing APC 0202 (Level VII Female Reproductive Procedures) to a C-APC to allow for further study of the complexity of pelvic floor repair procedures. After review of the information provided by the presenter and examination of the hospital outpatient claims data available for the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, the Panel did not make any recommendations regarding any of the female reproductive APCs.</p>

However, we proposed to restructure the female reproductive APCs to more appropriately reflect the resource and clinical characteristics of the procedures assigned to each APC. The proposed restructuring resulted in the use of five APCs for the CY 2015 OPPS update, as compared to the seven APCs used for the CY 2014 OPPS update. We believe that the proposed five-level APC structure will provide more accurate payments for the female reproductive procedures furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>

For CYs 2002, 2003, and 2006 through 2013, CPT code 57155 was assigned to APC 0192. For CYs 2004, 2005, and 2014, CPT code 57155 was assigned to APC 0193. Consistent with CMS&apos; statutory requirement under section 1833(t)(9) of the Act to review and revise APC assignments annually and to construct the most appropriate APC groupings as well as, to the extent desirable, correct any 2 times rule violations, we evaluated the resource consumption and clinical coherence associated with the female reproductive APCs for the CY 2015 OPPS update. Based on an analysis of the latest hospital outpatient claims data for this final rule with comment period, CPT code 57155 has a geometric mean cost of approximately $731 based on 858 single claims (out of 2,461 total claims). The geometric mean costs for the significant procedures assigned to APC 0192 range between approximately $398 (for CPT code 56605) and $731 (for CPT code 57155). Therefore, we believe that CPT code 57155 is appropriately assigned to APC 0192 based on the comparable resource costs associated with the other procedures assigned to this APC and are not making any changes to our proposal for this final rule with comment period. We note that APC 0192 had a proposed payment rate of approximately $501, which was based on hospital outpatient claims data submitted between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, and processed on or before December 31, 2013.

Instead, we are reassigning all of the hysteroscopy procedures that we proposed to assign<span id="page-66851" class="printed_page" data-page="66851"> </span>to APC 0190 to one of the female reproductive APCs. That is, we are reassigning all of the procedures proposed for reassignment to APC 0190 to APC 0188, APC 0193, or APC 0202. Consequently, with no procedures remaining in APC 0190, we deleted this APC for CY 2015. In addition, we are finalizing our proposal to restructure the female reproductive APCs to more appropriately reflect the resource and clinical characteristics of the procedures assigned to each APC. Specifically, we are finalizing our proposal to assign all of the female reproductive procedures to APCs 0188, 0189, 0192, 0193, or 0202. In addition, because of our revision to the hysteroscopy procedures APCs, we are revising the APC titles for the five female reproductive APCs; APC 0188, APC 0189, APC 0192, APC 0193, and APC 0202, from &#x201C;Female Reproductive Procedures&#x201D; to &#x201C;Gynecologic Procedures&#x201D; to more appropriately describe the procedures assigned to these APCs. Table 20 below lists the hysteroscopic procedures CPT codes, along with their long descriptors, proposed CY 2015 OPPS status indicators and APC assignments, as well as their final CY 2015 OPPS status indicators and APC assignments. Table 21 below lists the final APC titles and status indicators for the gynecologic procedure APCs. The final CY 2015 payment rates for the gynecologic procedures APCs, as well as the hysteroscopic procedures CPT codes listed in Table 21 can be found in Addendum B to this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site).</p>

          <p id="p-1215" data-page="66851">For the CY 2015 OPPS update, based on our review of the latest hospital outpatient claims data available for the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we proposed to restructure the APCs containing cystourethroscopy and other genitourinary procedures to more appropriately reflect the resource costs and clinical characteristics of the procedures assigned within each APC (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40987">79 FR 40987</a>). We note that, for the CY 2014 OPPS update, there are five levels of APCs that contain cystourethroscopy and genitourinary procedures. These APCs were listed in Table 26 of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40986">79 FR 40986</a>), along with their status indicator assignments for CY 2014. The proposed restructuring resulted in the use of four APCs for the CY 2015 OPPS update, as compared to the five APCs used for the CY 2014 OPPS update. Specifically, based on our review and evaluation of the procedures assigned to these APCs and the latest hospital outpatient claims data available, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we proposed to delete APC 0429 (Level V Cystourethroscopy and Other Genitourinary Procedures) and reassign the procedures that were previously assigned to this APC to either APC 0161 (Level I Cystourethroscopy and Other Genitourinary Procedures) or APC 0163 (Level IV Cystourethroscopy and Other Genitourinary Procedures). We believe that the procedures currently assigned to APC 0429 would be more appropriately assigned to either APC 0161 or APC 0163 based on their geometric mean costs for the CY 2015 OPPS update. Further, we believe that this proposed restructuring appropriately categorizes all of the cystourethroscopy and other genitourinary procedures that are comparable clinically and with respect to resource use within an APC group. We also proposed to delete APC 0169 (Lithotripsy) because the one procedure,<span id="page-66852" class="printed_page" data-page="66852"> </span>specifically the procedure described by CPT code 50590 (Lithotripsy, extracorporeal shock wave), that was assigned to this APC was proposed for reassignment to APC 0163 (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40987">79 FR 40987</a>). Table 27 of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40987">79 FR 40987</a>) listed the proposed APCs that contain cystourethroscopy and other genitourinary procedures, the APC titles, and the proposed status indicator assignments for CY 2015. The proposed payment rates for the specific APCs listed in Table 27 were listed in Addendum A to the proposed rule. The proposed payment rates for the specific cystourethroscopy and other genitourinary procedure codes were listed in Addendum B to the proposed rule. (Addenda A and B to the proposed rule are available via the Internet on the CMS Web site.)</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters opposed CMS&apos; proposal to delete APC 0169 and reassign the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) CPT code 50590 to APC 0163. The commenters noted that the procedure described by CPT code 50590 is classified as a noninvasive therapy and is not similar, clinically or with respect to resource costs, to the other more invasive surgical urological procedures that are proposed for assignment to APC 0163. One commenter stated that the ESWL procedure does not involve the use of an endoscope and, therefore, should not be assigned to APC 0163. This commenter believed that the payment rate for APC 0163 would be influenced by dominating the claims data for CPT code 50590 because ESWL is a commonly performed procedure resulting in a significant high volume of single frequency claims. The commenter requested that CMS delay finalizing this proposal or, alternatively, reassign CPT code 50590 to APC 0162 (Level III Cystourethroscopy and Other Genitourinary Procedures) because this APC encompasses a broader and more diverse grouping of procedures than APC 0163.</p>
          <p id="p-1217" data-page="66852">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As part of our standard annual OPPS update process, we review each APC assignment for the clinical similarity and resource homogeneity of the procedures assigned to each APC. An analysis of our latest hospital outpatient claims data available for this final rule with comment period revealed a geometric mean cost of approximately $3,094 based on 32,370 single claims (out of 44,816 total claims) for CPT code 50590, which is comparable to the geometric mean cost of approximately $3,230 for APC 0163. The significant procedures assigned to APC 0163 have geometric mean costs ranging between $2,946 and $4,088. We do not agree with the commenters that APC 0162 is the more appropriate APC assignment because the geometric mean cost for this APC, approximately $2,163, is significantly lower than the geometric mean cost of approximately $3,094 for CPT code 50590. In addition, the geometric mean cost of APC 0163 (using proposed rule data) and without CPT code 50590 assigned to this APC was approximately $3,058, which is close to the final rule geometric mean cost of CPT code 50590 of $3,094. Although the ESWL procedure does not involve the use of an endoscope, we note that not every procedure proposed for reassignment, or ultimately reassigned, to APC 0163 uses an endoscope. In addition, we do not agree with the commenters that the ESWL procedure is not clinically similar to the other procedures assigned to APC 0163. There are no general rules for clinical similarity that apply to all APCs. Instead, the evaluation of clinical similarity depends upon the particular characteristics of the services being evaluated for a particular APC assignment. The use of single procedure APCs, like APC 0169, the APC to which CPT code 50590 is assigned for CY 2014, generally is not considered appropriate under the OPPS because payment rates based on a single procedure code&apos;s geometric mean cost is more consistent with a fee schedule than a prospective payment system. However, there are limited circumstances in which we assign a single procedure code to an APC; for example, the intraocular procedures assigned to an APC series. Specifically, APC 0673 (Level III Intraocular Procedures) has a geometric mean cost of approximately $3,239. APC 0293 (Level IV Intraocular Procedures) is the next higher level APC in the intraocular procedures APC series, and it has a single procedure (CPT code 65770 (Keratoprosthesis)) assigned to it, which has a geometric mean cost of approximately $8,766. The highest cost procedure assigned to APC 0673 is CPT code 67113 (Repair of complex retinal detachment), which has a geometric mean cost of approximately $4,065. The geometric mean cost of CPT code 65770 is significantly higher, 2.2 times the geometric mean cost of CPT code 67113. Therefore, we assigned CPT code 65770 to a different APC because the resource costs are not similar. Because the procedure described by CPT code 65770 is an intraocular surgery and there are no other APCs that contain clinically similar procedures, we assigned CPT code 65770 to APC 0293 without any other procedures. Continuing in this series, we assigned CPT code 0308T (Insertion of intraocular telescope prosthesis including removal of crystalline lens) to APC 0351 (Level V Intraocular Procedures) without any other procedures. CPT code 0308T has a geometric mean cost of approximately $23,947, which is 2.73 times the geometric mean cost of the procedure described by CPT code 65770, which is assigned to APC 0293, which is one level lower than APC 0351 in the intraocular procedures APC series. CPT code 0308T is the only procedure code assigned to APC 0351 because there are no other procedures that are similar in terms of resource costs. We do not believe that similar APC series assignment is applicable to CPT code 50590. Therefore, we proposed to reassign CPT code 50590 to APC 0163 and delete APC 0169 (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40986">79 FR 40986</a> through 40987). In summary, based on our review of the latest hospital outpatient claims data for this final rule with comment period, we believe that CPT code 50590 would be appropriately assigned to APC 0163 based on its clinical and resource similarity to the other procedures assigned to APC 0163, several of which are dedicated to kidney stone removal. Therefore, we are finalizing our proposal, without modification, to assign CPT code 50590 to APC 0163 for CY 2015.</p>

The commenters noted that CPT code 55875 has been assigned to APC 0163 since the code&apos;s inception in CY 2007, and believed that the proposed payment rate for APC 0163 more accurately reflects the resources necessary to provide this service.

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As has been our practice since the implementation of the OPPS in 2000, we review, on an annual basis, the APC assignments for the procedures and services paid under the OPPS. Based on the latest hospital outpatient claims data used for this final rule with comment period, our analysis does not support the reassignment of CPT code 53850 to APC 0163. Our analysis of the claims data shows a geometric mean cost of approximately $1,542 for CPT code 53850 based on 107 single claims (out of 142 total claims), which is relatively similar to the geometric mean cost of approximately $1,273 for APC 0161. While we acknowledge that both procedures are similar, our analysis of the claims data shows that the resource costs of providing the procedure described by CPT code 53852 is significantly higher than the resource cost of providing the procedure described by CPT code 53850. Specifically, the geometric mean cost for CPT code 53852 is approximately $3,339 based on 98 single claims (out of 156 total claims), which is comparable to the geometric mean cost of APC 0163 of approximately $3,230. We do not agree with the commenters that APC 0163 is the more appropriate APC assignment because its geometric mean cost is significantly higher than the geometric mean cost of CPT code 53850 of approximately $1,542.

The commenter also believed that the TIPs are unable to be performed in the ASC setting because of the inadequate payment rate for the specific APCs. The commenter believed that the procedures described by HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 are device dependent because a majority of the procedures&apos; costs are associated with the costs of the implants, with a mean of 4.9 implants per procedure. The commenter also believed that there is considerable variation in the number of implants used for each procedure. The commenter believed that the ASC payment is extremely low because the procedures are not designated as &#x201C;device intensive&#x201D; in the ASC setting (that is, the procedures are not assigned to ASC payment indicator &#x201C;J8&#x201D;), nor are the procedures assigned to a C-APC under the OPPS, which would most likely allow for the performance of the device-intensive treatment in the ASC setting, similar to most of the proposed C-APCs that are defined as device-intensive APCs. The commenter stated that the proposed OPPS payments for HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 are inadequate to cover both the costs of the number of implants required and the cost of the procedure. The commenter recommended several possible APC assignments to improve the payments for TIPs. The commenter recommended using new CPT codes 52441 and 52442<span id="page-66854" class="printed_page" data-page="66854"> </span>to report the TIPs under the OPPS, and assigning the procedures to C-APC 0385 (Level I Urogenital Procedures) because the proposed payment rate for C-APC 0385 of approximately $7,659 is comparable to the estimated cost of performing TIPs using 5 implants, which is approximately $7,519. The commenter&apos;s second recommendation was to continue to report the performance of the TIPs using HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740, and to assign HCPCS code C9740 to APC 0385, as described previously, and HCPCS code C9739 to APC 0202 (Level V Female Reproductive Procedures) and remove &#x201C;Female&#x201D; from the title of APC 0202. According to the commenter, the proposed payment for APC 0202 of approximately $4,366 is equivalent to the cost of a TIP using 2 or 3 implants. The commenter believed that because APC 0202 is designated as a C-APC, the ASC payment for the procedure would also prove to be adequate. The commenter&apos;s third recommendation was to use new CPT codes 52441 and 52442 to report TIPs and to assign the procedure codes to APC 0168 (Level II Urethral Procedures) on an interim basis until OPPS claims data are available for these codes. The commenter believed that the proposed payment rate for APC 0168 of approximately $2,533 more appropriately equates to the cost of a single implant procedure described by CPT code 52441, while additional implant procedures described by CPT code 52442 would be paid at 50 percent, or approximately $1,267, because APC 0168 is subject to the multiple procedure discount (that is, the APC is assigned to status indicator &#x201C;T&#x201D;), which, the commenter claimed, more appropriately equates to the estimated cost of providing the procedure described by CPT code 52442 of approximately $1,248. However, the commenter noted that, because APC 0168 is not a C-APC, payment for the procedure may not be designated as &#x201C;device intensive&#x201D; to ensure adequate ASC payment. The commenter recommended that CMS consider any procedure that has device costs that are greater than 40 percent as device intensive.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We agree with the commenter that the cost of the implants associated with the procedures described by HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 represents the majority of the costs of the procedures. We considered those costs and the variation in the number of implants per procedure when we created HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 and assigned the procedure codes to APCs 0162 and 1564, respectively. We believe that HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 are preferable to the new CPT codes 52441 and 52442 with respect to OPPS and ASC payments because the new codes describe complete procedures instead of the insertion of individual implants, which are almost always incomplete procedures because patients usually receive multiple implants. We do not believe that any of the APCs recommended by the commenter are appropriate for assignment of HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 at this time because our usual policy with new codes is to wait until we have OPPS claims data available before making an APC reassignment. In regard to the ASC payment for the procedures, neither APC 0162 nor APC 1564 is designated as device intensive. Therefore, the multiple procedure payment reduction under OPPS applies to the entire payment amount under the ASC payment as well. Currently, there is no policy regarding designating services that are assigned to a New Technology APC as device intensive for the ASC setting. We may consider such a policy in future rulemakings.</p>
          <p id="p-1228" data-page="66854">We will maintain payment for the cystourethroscopy with insertion of TIPs using HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 because we believe that the code descriptors more appropriately reflect complete procedures and the distribution of implant utilization per patient. For CY 2015, we are maintaining our APC assignments for HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 to APCs 0162 and 1564, respectively. The APC assignments for HCPCS codes C9739 and C9740 are initial APC assignments until we obtain claims data for these two codes for the CY 2016 OPPS update. The final CY 2015 geometric mean costs for APC 0162 is approximately $2,163, and the final CY 2015 payment rate (there are no geometric mean costs for New Technology APCs, only payment bands) for APC 1564 is approximately $4,750. CPT codes 52441 and 52442 will not be payable under the OPPS for CY 2015; we are assigning these two CPT codes to status indicator &#x201C;B&#x201D; (Codes that are not recognized by OPPS when submitted on an outpatient hospital Part B bill type (12x and 13x)).</p>
          <p id="p-1229" data-page="66854">After consideration of the public comments we received, we also are finalizing our proposal to restructure the APCs containing cystourethroscopy, transprostatic implant procedures, and other genitourinary procedures, and to use a four-level APC grouping to classify the procedures based on our analysis of the latest hospital outpatient claims data available for this final rule with comment period. The final payment rates for the cystourethroscopy, transprostatic implant procedures, and other genitourinary procedure codes, as well as the specific CPT codes on which we received public comments and that are discussed in this section, can be found in Addendum B to this final rule with comment period, which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site. The final payment rates for APCs 0160, 0161, 0162, and 0163, which are the final CY 2015 cystourethroscopy, transprostatic implant procedures, and other genitourinary APCs, can be found in Addendum A to this final rule with comment period, which is also available via the Internet on the CMS Web site.</p>
          <p id="p-1230" data-page="66854">We remind commenters that every year we revise, if necessary, the APC assignments for procedure codes based on our analysis of the latest hospital outpatient claims data. We anticipate that there will be further significant revisions to the urology-related APCs in futures years because the current overall APC structure is suboptimal and can be improved with respect to the clinical similarity and resource similarity of the groupings. In addition, we note that section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to review, on a recurring basis occurring no less than annually, and revise the groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments to take into account changes in medical practice, changes in technology, the addition of new services, new cost data, and other relevant information and factors. Although we do not discuss every APC change in the proposed and final rules with comment period, these changes are listed in Addendum B to the proposed and final rules with comment period. Specifically, procedure codes with proposed revisions to the APC and/or status indicator assignments are assigned to comment indicator &#x201C;CH&#x201D; (Active HCPCS code in current year and next calendar year, status indicator and/or APC assignment has changed) in Addendum B to the proposed rule.</p>

          <p id="p-1231" data-page="66854">We created HCPCS code C9735 (Anoscopy; with directed submucosal injection(s), any substance) effective April 1, 2013, and assigned the service to APC 0150 (Level IV Anal/Rectal Procedures) for CY 2013, which had a payment rate of $2,365.97. We maintained the assignment of HCPCS code C9735 to APC 0150 for CY 2014, with a payment rate of $2,501.31. HCPCS code C9735 involves injection of a bulking agent, L8605 (Injectable bulking agent dextranomer/hyaluronic<span id="page-66855" class="printed_page" data-page="66855"> </span>acid copolymer implant, anal canal, 1 ml, includes shipping and necessary supplies). One commenter in response to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC proposed rule believed that the proposed assignment for HCPCS code C9735 to APC 0150 was inappropriate, and asserted that the entire HCPCS code C9735 procedure costs far more than the proposed payment rate for APC 0150. The commenter recommended creating a new Level V Anal/Rectal Procedures APC, composed of HCPCS code C9735, and two other procedures. CMS responded in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period that HCPCS code C9735 became effective April 1, 2013, so there were no claims data yet on this procedure, and that our longstanding policy is to wait until there are claims data on a new procedure before reassigning the service to another clinical APC (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74981">78 FR 74981</a>). We did not agree with the commenters that creating a Level V Anal/Rectal Procedures APC was warranted for CY 2014. We believed that the suggested Level V APC would have a low volume of single frequency claims, and HCPCS code C9735 had no claims volume at that time. We stated that the low volume of claims for such an APC would contribute to APC cost and payment volatility.</p>
          <p id="p-1232" data-page="66855">For CY 2015, we proposed to maintain the assignment of HCPCS code C9735 to APC 0150, which had a proposed payment rate of $2,612.71. The AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel created new Category III CPT code 0377T (Anoscopy with directed submucosal injection of bulking agent for fecal incontinence), which describes the procedure performed by HCPCS code C9735, to be effective January 1, 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-1233" data-page="66855">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters recommended that CMS divide APC 0150 into two APCs by creating a higher cost Level V Anal/Rectal Procedures APC. The commenters stated that there are four procedure codes that have a geometric mean cost that is more than $500 higher than the proposed geometric mean cost of APC 0150, which is $2,735.52, and one procedure code that has a geometric mean cost that is approximately $300 higher than the proposed geometric mean cost of APC 0150. One commenter specifically stated that the proposed payment rate for APC 0150 is insufficient to cover the cost of the procedure described by HCPCS code C9735, which is one of the five procedure codes recommended for assignment to the suggested Level V Anal/Rectal Procedures APC, because the proposed payment rate for APC 0150 is lower than the total cost of the procedure. The commenter pointed out that the proposed geometric mean cost of HCPCS code C9735 is $3,241.32, which is considerably higher that the proposed geometric mean cost of APC 0150, which is $2,735.52. The commenter also recommended creating a Level V Anal/Rectal Procedures APC, and assigning HCPCS code C9735 and other codes to this recommended APC. In addition, the commenter recommended that CMS use new CPT code 0377T for hospitals to report the anoscopy with directed submucosal injection of bulking agent for fecal incontinence procedure, effective January 1, 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-1234" data-page="66855">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The claims data available for this final rule with comment period, which are used to establish final payment rates for the CY 2015 OPPS, show a geometric mean cost of approximately $2,698 for APC 0150, while the geometric mean cost for HCPCS code C9735 is approximately $2,863 based on 56 single frequency claims. We believe that the geometric mean cost of HCPCS code C9735 is similar to the geometric mean cost of APC 0150. Further, the procedure described by HCPCS code C9735 is no longer one of the five highest cost procedures assigned to APC 0150 based on claims data available for this final rule with comment period. Similarly, there are other higher cost, lower volume procedures with geometric mean costs that are greater than the geometric mean cost of APC 0150, but do not create a violation of the 2 times rule because of the APC assignment. For instance, CPT code 46762 (Sphincteroplasty, anal, for incontinence, adult; implantation artificial sphincter) has a final rule geometric mean cost of approximately $11,873 based on 9 single frequency claims. The volume of claims for this CPT code is too low to consider this procedure significant for purposes of evaluating a potential violation of the 2 times rule. Therefore, we do not believe that the range of costs for the significant procedures assigned to APC 0150 warrants the creation of a higher level APC. Based on claims data available for this final rule with comment period, the five highest cost procedures assigned to APC 0150 have a total number of single frequency claims that equals less than 220 claims. The suggested Level V Anal/Rectal Procedures APC would have a low volume of single frequency claims and would contribute to APC cost and payment volatility, as was the case when based on CY 2014 claims data. As we stated in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we are not accepting the commenter&apos;s recommendation because a low volume APC will contribute to the APC&apos;s cost volatility, which in turn contributes to payment volatility for the procedures assigned to the low volume APC (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74981">78 FR 74981</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-1235" data-page="66855">After consideration of the public comments we received regarding the composition of APC 0150, we are finalizing our proposal to continue to assign HCPCS code C9735 to APC 0150 for CY 2015. The CY 2015 final geometric mean cost of APC 0150 is approximately $2,698. In addition, new CPT code 0377T also is assigned to APC 0150 for CY 2015 because we agree with the commenters that HCPCS code C9735 should be deleted after December 31, 2014.

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter believed that CMS&apos; proposal to continue to assign CPT codes 50593 and 0340T to APC 0423 does not accurately reflect the costs incurred when performing these cryoablation procedures. The commenter noted that APC 0423 includes several other radiofrequency ablation and endoscopy procedures, which do not include high-cost device systems like the cryoablation procedures described by CPT codes 50593 and 0340T. Although the commenter acknowledged that there is no violation of the 2 times rule, the commenter stated that the proposed geometric mean cost of CPT code 50593 is significantly higher than the proposed geometric mean cost of APC 0423. In addition, the commenter asserted that the cryoablation procedures described by CPT codes 50593 and 0340T are not clinically similar to other procedures assigned to APC 0423. The commenter further noted that less than half of claims used to establish the proposed geometric mean cost of CPT code 50593 were correctly coded, and did not include the device HCPCS code C2618 (Probe, cryoablation). The commenter<span id="page-66856" class="printed_page" data-page="66856"> </span>recommended that CMS create a new Level III Percutaneous Abdominal and Biliary Procedures APC, and assign CPT codes 50593 and 0340T to this APC.</p>

The claims data available for this final rule with comment period show a geometric mean cost of approximately $4,249 for APC 0423, and approximately $4,985 for CPT code 50593, which is based on 749 single frequency claims. The geometric mean cost of CPT code 50593 is the highest cost procedure assigned to APC 0423, but is well within a normal range of costs associated with the other procedures assigned to this APC, and does not approach the 2 times limit that would create a violation of the 2 times rule. CPT code 0340T has no claims at this time because the procedure code became effective beginning in CY 2014. Therefore, we do not believe that a new Level III Percutaneous Abdominal and Biliary Procedures APC is warranted based on the geometric mean cost of CPT code 50593 relative to the geometric mean cost of APC 0423. We also remind the commenter that we typically do not investigate allegations of hospital cost underreporting or incorrect coding. As we stated in the CY 2011 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, &#x201C;Beyond our standard OPPS trimming methodology . . . that we apply to those claims that have passed various types of claims processing edits, it is not our general policy to judge the accuracy of hospital coding and charging for purposes of ratesetting&#x201D; (<a href="/citation/75-FR-71838">75 FR 71838</a>). We believe that the cryoablation procedures described by CPT codes 50593 and 0340T are clinically similar to the other procedures assigned to APC 0423. Many of the procedures assigned to APC 0423 are ablative procedures, and all of the procedures assigned to this APC are abdominal or biliary. Therefore, we are finalizing the CY 2015 proposal, without modification, to continue to assign CPT codes 50593 and 0340T to APC 0423. We will specifically review the APC assignment of CPT code 0340T when claims data for this service become available.</p>

For CY 2011, the CPT Editorial Panel deleted CPT code 0160T on December 31, 2010, and replaced this procedure code with CPT code 90867 (Therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) treatment; initial, including cortical mapping, motor threshold determination, delivery and management), effective January 1, 2011. Similarly, CPT code 0161T was deleted on December 31, 2010, and was replaced with CPT code 90868 (Therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) treatment; subsequent delivery and management, per session), effective January 1, 2011. In CY 2012, the CPT Editorial Panel established an additional TMS therapy code, specifically, CPT code 90869 (Therapeutic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) treatment; subsequent motor threshold re-determination with delivery and management), that became effective January 1, 2012.</p>

For the CY 2015 update, as listed in Addendum B to the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we proposed to continue to assign CPT code 90869 to APC 0218, with a proposed payment rate of approximately $160.

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter disagreed with CMS&apos; proposal to reassign CPT codes 90867 and 90868 from APC 0216 to APC 0218, and to continue to assign CPT code 90869 to APC 0218. The commenter stated that the proposed addition of certain nerve conduction study codes to APC 0218 for the CY 2015 update has negatively affected the proposed payment rate for APC 0218. The commenter believed that this proposal resulted in a decreased payment rate of approximately $160 for APC 0218, compared to the CY 2014 payment rate of approximately $217; thereby effectuating a potential financial loss for the provider with each treatment because a typical course of TMS therapy includes a total of 25 daily treatment sessions. In addition, the commenter stated that assigning CPT codes 90867, 90868, and 90869 to APC 0218 is clinically inappropriate because these CPT codes describe therapy services, whereas the other procedure codes assigned to APC 0218 describe diagnostic tests (simple nerve conduction and electromyography studies). To correct the perceived clinical and resource discrepancies, the commenter suggested that CMS establish a new APC specifically for the TMS therapy codes, and that CMS title the APC &#x201C;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.&#x201D;</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We believe that APC 0218 is the most appropriate APC assignment for the three TMS therapy CPT codes. The CPT codes describing the procedures assigned to APC 0218 all describe noninvasive services that affect the nervous system. Based on the latest hospital outpatient claims data used for this final rule with comment period, our analysis revealed that the resources associated with providing the services described by CPT codes 90867, 90868, and 90869 are comparable to the other services assigned to APC 0218. Specifically, based on CY 2013 claims data used for this final rule with comment period, the geometric mean cost for CPT code 90867 is approximately $210 based on 72 single claims (out of 72 total claims), the geometric mean cost for CPT code 90868 is approximately $201 based on 2,513 single claims (out of 2,516 total claims), and the geometric mean cost for CPT code 90869 is approximately $194 based on 28 single claims (out of 30 total claims). In addition, a review of the procedures assigned to APC 0218 shows that the range of geometric mean cost for the services assigned to APC 0218 is approximately between $95 (for CPT code 95937) and $327 (for CPT code 95875), which is comparable to the geometric mean costs for all three TMS therapy CPT codes. Based on the clinical and resource similarities in relation to the other procedures currently assigned to APC 0218, we believe that the TMS therapy codes would be appropriately assigned to APC 0218.</p>

          <br><p><b>5. Ocular Services: Ophthalmic Procedures and Services</b></p>

          <p id="p-1252" data-page="66857">For the CY 2015 OPPS update, based on our evaluation of the latest hospital outpatient claims data, we proposed to restructure all of the ophthalmic APCs to better reflect the costs and clinical characteristics of the procedures within each APC. This proposed restructuring resulted in the use of 13 APCs for the ophthalmology-related procedures for the CY 2015 OPPS update, as compared to the 24 APCs used for the CY 2014 OPPS update. We believe that this major<span id="page-66858" class="printed_page" data-page="66858"> </span>restructuring and consolidation of APCs more appropriately categorizes all of the ophthalmology-related procedures and services within an APC group, such that the services within each newly-configured APC are more comparable clinically and with respect to resource use. Tables 19 and 20 in the proposed rule showed the current CY 2014 and proposed CY 2015 ophthalmology-related APCs. Specifically, Table 19 of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40981">79 FR 40981</a>) showed the CY 2014 ophthalmology-related APCs and status indicator assignments, while Table 20 showed the proposed restructured ophthalmology-related APCs and their status indicator assignments for CY 2015 (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40981">79 FR 40981</a> through 40982). The proposed payment rates for the ophthalmology-related APCs listed in Table 20 were listed in Addendum B to the proposed rule (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site).</p>
          <p id="p-1253" data-page="66858">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we invited public comments on this proposal.</p>
          <p id="p-1254" data-page="66858">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters stated that the proposed restructuring and consolidation of the CY 2015 ophthalmic APC is substantial, and requested that CMS not finalize this proposal. The commenters also stated that CMS has not provided information regarding the criteria used to differentiate the various levels of treatments or procedures for the restructured 13 ophthalmic APCs. The commenters stated that the configuration and structure of the existing 24 APCs do not appear to be inconsistent with the requirements for clinical coherence or resource use. The commenters disagreed with CMS&apos; proposal to establish broader categories within these APCs, and indicated that such a change in APC groupings has the potential to aggregate procedures that vary significantly in resource costs and clinical coherence. In addition, the commenters stated that some of the procedures in the restructured ophthalmic APCs appear to be inappropriately categorized. For example, the restructuring of the ophthalmic APCs has resulted in the consolidation of cornea procedures within one of the restructured APCs, and the procedures are no longer assigned to a separate classification grouping based on the previous APC configurations. The commenters pointed out that the major cornea transplant codes have been reassigned to restructured APC 0673 (Level III Intraocular Procedures), along with procedures that treat glaucoma and retina conditions. The commenters further explained that the equipment used for these services when performed in alternative settings and the depths of the condition of the eye and the appropriate treatments vastly differ, as does the time and other resources necessary to perform these types of surgeries. As a result, the commenters believed that additional APCs are needed to appropriately categorize ophthalmic procedures based on clinical homogeneity and resource consumption. The commenters also requested the opportunity to work with CMS to make appropriate adjustments to the restructured ophthalmic APC groupings to ensure clinical coherence and to minimize payment variances for these procedures.</p>
          <p id="p-1255" data-page="66858">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Consistent with CMS&apos; statutory requirement under section 1833(t)(9) of the Act to review and revise APC assignments annually and to construct the most appropriate APC groupings, as well as, to the extent desirable, correct any 2 times rule violations, we evaluated the resource consumption and clinical coherence associated with the ophthalmic APCs for the CY 2015 update. Based on our analysis of the latest hospital outpatient claims data used for this final rule with comment period and understanding of the clinical aspects of these procedures, we believe that the restructured and consolidated ophthalmic APCs more appropriately group these ophthalmology-related services according to their current resource costs, as well as their clinical characteristics. The former ophthalmic procedures APC structure unnecessarily separated, from a clinical and resource similarity prospective, ophthalmic procedures based on disease state or traditional subdivisions within ophthalmic surgery. APC groupings were never intended to precisely track traditional ophthalmology subspecialty divisions, such as cornea surgery, retina surgery, or glaucoma surgery, as the commenters suggested. We also believe that larger APC groupings are more consistent with a prospective payment system than smaller groupings. We note that we regularly accept meetings from interested parties throughout the year, and we encourage stakeholders to continue a dialogue with us during the rulemaking cycle and throughout the year on our continuing efforts to improve the coherence of the OPPS APC groupings.</p>
          <p id="p-1256" data-page="66858">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal, without modification, to restructure and consolidate the ophthalmic APCs. Table 22 below shows the final ophthalmology-related APCs and their status indicator assignments for CY 2015. The final payment rates for these APCs can be found in Addendum B to this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site). We also remind the public that we review the OPPS and APC structures and assignments annually and may propose additional restructurings of the APCs and procedure code assignments for other clinical areas and APC groupings in CY 2016 and future rulemakings.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Based on our review of the latest hospital outpatient claims data available for this final rule with comment period, we agree with the commenter that CPT codes 76825 and 76826 should be reassigned to APC 0269, which more appropriately supports the clinical and resource homogeneity of the APCs rather than reassigning the procedure codes to APC 0697. The geometric mean cost of CPT code 76825 is approximately $384, and the geometric mean cost of CPT code 76826 is approximately $285. These costs are sufficiently close to the geometric mean cost of CPT code 93306 (Echocardiography, transthoracic, real time with image documentation (2D), includes M-mode recording, when performed, complete, with spectral Doppler echocardiography, and with color flow Doppler echocardiography), which is approximately $430. CPT code 93306 comprises 93 percent of the service volume within APC 0269. By reassigning CPT codes 76825 and 76826 to APC 0269, only one procedure code would remain in APC 0697. Therefore, we also are reassigning CPT code 93308 (Echocardiography, transthoracic, real time with image documentation (2D), includes M-mode recording, when performed, follow-up or limited study) from APC 0697 to APC 0267 (Level III Diagnostic and Screening Ultrasound) for CY 2015. We are deleting APC 0697 for the CY 2015 OPPS update because all of the procedure codes previously assigned to APC 0697 have been reassigned to more appropriate APCs to ensure adequate payment for the services provided and the clinical and resource homogeneity of APCs.</p>

As clarified in the CY 2008 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/72-FR-66627">72 FR 66627</a>), we define &#x201C;intraoperative&#x201D; procedures as services that are provided during and, therefore, on the same date of service as another procedure that is separately payable under the OPPS. We further define intraoperative as services that support the performance of an independent procedure and are provided in the same operative session as the independent procedure. Both of the procedures described by CPT codes 0351T and 0353T must always be performed in conjunction with another procedure; specifically, the surgical procedure is performed followed by the breast OCT to improve the surgical outcome. We believe that these procedure codes clearly describe services that conform to the definition of &#x201C;intraoperative&#x201D; procedures. For further information on our policy for intraoperative services under the hospital OPPS, we refer readers to the CY 2008 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/72-FR-66627">72 FR 66627</a> through 66630).</p>

In conjunction with this proposed change, we proposed to reassign the following three services to proposed newly renamed APC 0667 for CY 2015: CPT codes 77522, 77523, and 77525.</p>

The commenters supported the proposal to reassign CPT code 77520 from APC 0664 to APC 0412. However, the commenters expressed concern regarding the proposal to reassign CPT code 77522 from APC 0664 to proposed newly renamed APC 0667. Commenters disagreed with CMS&apos; determination that the procedure described by CPT code 77522 is clinically similar and comparable in geometric mean cost to the other services assigned to APC 0667 in 2014, specifically the procedures described by CPT codes 77523 and 77525. The commenters recommended that CMS maintain the assignment of CPT code 77522 to APC 0664 and not delete the classification grouping, which would result in CPT code 77522 being the only service assigned to this APC.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate the commenters&apos; support for our proposals regarding the radiation therapy APCs, specifically our proposal to reassign CPT code 77520 from APC 0664 to APC 0412. In regard to the proposed reassignment of CPT code 77522 from APC 0664 to APC 0667, we disagree with the commenters for the following reasons. The three CPT codes, 77522, 77523, and 77525, are similar clinically. All three of these CPT codes describe procedures that involve proton beam therapy delivery services with a continuum of complexity. The procedure described by CPT code 77520 is the least complex. The procedure described by CPT code 77522 is more complex than the procedure described by CPT code 77520, and the procedure described by CPT code 77523 is more complex than the procedure described by CPT code 77522. The procedure described by CPT code 77525 is the most complex procedure of the series proposed to be reassigned to APC 0667. We proposed to reassign CPT code 77520 from APC 0664 to APC 0412 because of the resource comparability with respect to the other procedures involving proton beam therapy delivery services assigned to APC 0412, not based on the clinical dissimilarity with respect to the procedures assigned to APC 0664. In regard to the remaining three procedures involving proton beam therapy delivery services (the procedures described by CPT codes 77522, 77523, and 77525), we believe that these procedures are clinically similar, but each has a slightly varying level of complexity relative to the others. The proposed configuration of APC 0667 only contains the three proton beam therapy delivery services described by CPT codes 77522, 77523, and 77525, and does not include any other service codes. APC 0667 is the most clinically homogeneous APC<span id="page-66861" class="printed_page" data-page="66861"> </span>under the OPPS to assign these services that would ensure adequate payment, with the exception of single service APCs. With regard to the resource comparability of the procedures described by CPT codes 77522, 77523 and 77525, the lowest geometric mean cost among these procedures is associated with the procedure described by CPT code 77522, which is approximately $1,033, and the highest geometric mean cost is associated with the procedure described by CPT code 77525, which is approximately $1,244. The statutory prong that dictates when resources become dissimilar between two services is the 2 times rule. Based on the limitations imposed by the 2 times rule, the highest cost significant service assigned to an APC cannot exceed the lowest cost by greater than two times. In this case, the geometric mean cost of the procedure described by CPT code 77525 is only 1.2 times the geometric mean cost of the procedure described by CPT code 77522, which is well within the 2 times limit. Therefore, we determined that the resource similarity among the services proposed to be reassigned to APC 0667 is comparable. In addition, we generally prefer to assign procedures to the most appropriate APC that would ensure adequate payment, as opposed to using single-service APCs, which the commenters recommended for the procedure described by CPT code 77522, unless no other reasonable options exist, because single-service APCs are more consistent with a fee schedule than a prospective payment system.</p>
          <p id="p-1271" data-page="66861">Therefore, we are finalizing the following proposals affecting the proton beam therapy services for CY 2015: (1) We are reassigning CPT code 77520 from APC 0664 to APC 0412; (2) we are reassigning CPT code 77522 from 0664 to APC 0667;(3) we are reassigning CPT codes 77523 and 77525 to APC 0667; (4) we are deleting APC 0664; and (5) we are renaming APC 0667 to &#x201C;Level IV Radiation Therapy.&#x201D;</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter applauded CMS for the establishment of new APC 0446, the APC to which the MEG procedures are proposed to be reassigned. The commenter believed that the reassignment of CPT codes 95965 and 95966 would produce more accurate data related to MEG usage. Alternatively, one commenter expressed concern that the current proposal does not adequately cover the costs associated with providing MEG services, and urged CMS to work with hospitals and other stakeholders to ensure that HOPDs submit claims correctly to capture the full costs of providing these services.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Based on our analysis of the latest hospital outpatient claims data used for this final rule with comment period, we believe that the establishment of APC 0446 is necessary to ensure clinical and resource homogeneity and adequate payment for MEG services.

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> For the CY 2014 update, we finalized our proposal to adopt the full range of SRS CPT codes and to discontinue the use of the remaining SRS G-codes under the OPPS. HOPDs must use and report SRS CPT codes 77371, 77372, and 77371 to describe the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery treatment services under the OPPS. For a full discussion of this issue, we refer readers to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74989">78 FR 74989</a> through 749995). In addition, for the CY 2015 update, HCPCS code G0173 (Linear accelerator based stereotactic radiosurgery, complete course of therapy in one session), and HCPCS code G0251 ((Linear accelerator based stereotactic radiosurgery, delivery including collimator changes and custom plugging, fractionated treatment, all lesions, per session, maximum five sessions per course of treatment)) will be deleted, effective December 31, 2014, because these codes will no longer be used under the MPFS. However, HCPCS code G0339 (Image-guided robotic linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery, complete course of therapy in one session or first session of fractionated treatment) and HCPCS code G0340 (Image-guided robotic linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery, delivery including collimator changes and custom plugging, fractionated treatment, all lesions, per session, second through fifth sessions, maximum five sessions per course of treatment) will continue to be used under the MPFS and, therefore, will continue to be active codes for the CY 2015 MPFS update. However, HCPCS codes G0339 and G0340 will not be active codes for the CY 2015 OPPS update. Instead, HOPDs must use and report SRS CPT codes 77371, 77372, and 77373 to describe the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery treatment services under the OPPS.</p>

Several commenters recommended excluding the claims data for HCPCS code G0251 prior to determining the final payment rate for APC 0066. The commenters indicated that HCPCS code G0251 is used most often for fractionated cranial SRS, not for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), as described by CPT code 77373.<span id="page-66862" class="printed_page" data-page="66862"> </span>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Both HCPCS code G0251 and CPT code 77373 describe fractionated cranial stereotactic radiosurgery services that involve between 2 and 5 fractions of treatment. Single-session cranial SRS are reported using either CPT code 77371 or 77372. Based on the code descriptor, we believe that the service described by HCPCS code G0251 is appropriately crosswalked to the service described by CPT code 77373. We explained the code crosswalk in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74991">78 FR 74991</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-1282" data-page="66862">We note that, under the OPPS, we may make exceptions to the 2 times rule in unusual cases, such as low-volume items or services. For the CY 2015 update (taking into consideration the APC changes that we proposed for CY 2015), we reviewed all of the APCs to determine which APCs would not satisfy the requirement of the 2 times rule. In the case of APC 0066, we believe that it is necessary to make an exception to the 2 times rule for this APC because the three G-codes that caused the violation of the 2 times rule to occur have been crosswalked to CPT code 77373. We expect to have claims data for only CPT code 77373 available for the CY 2016 rulemaking. At that time, we will reevaluate the APC assignments for all of the SRS CPT codes.</p>

Specifically, for CY 2015, we proposed to reassign HCPCS codes 0071T (Focused ultrasound ablation of uterine leiomyomata, including mr guidance; total leiomyomata volume less than 200 cc of tissue), 0072T (Focused ultrasound ablation of uterine leiomyomata, including mr guidance; total leiomyomata volume greater or equal to 200 cc of tissue), C9734 (Focused ultrasound ablation/therapeutic intervention, other than uterine leiomyomata, with magnetic resonance (mr) guidance), and 0301T (Destruction/reduction of malignant breast tumor with externally applied focused microwave, including interstitial placement of disposable catheter with combined temperature monitoring probe and microwave focusing sensocatheter under ultrasound thermotherapy guidance) from APC 0065 (IORT, MRgFUS, and MEG) to APC 0066.

The commenters further believed that the MRgFUS procedures would be more appropriately assigned to a C-APC from a clinical and resource perspective. The commenters explained that certain procedures are commonly reported in conjunction with MRgFUS procedures, similar to stereotactic radiosurgery procedures.

Currently, we do not have any single claims reporting any of the four MRgFUS procedures. However, because we are deleting APC 0065, we believe that reassigning these procedures to APC 0066 for the CY 2015 update is more appropriate because, in the past, MRgFUS services were assigned to the same APC as some of the former fractionated linac-based SRS G-codes. We also believe that the MRgFUS procedures are clinically dissimilar to single-session cranial SRS because MRgFUS procedures may involve more than one treatment session.

          <p id="p-1287" data-page="66862">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we proposed to continue the APC assignment of the procedure codes that have been historically assigned to APC 0415 (Level II Endoscopy Lower Airway). Commenters responding to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC proposed rule had recommended that CMS split the procedure codes assigned to APC 0415 into two levels of lower airway endoscopy APCs. We did not split APC 0415 into two levels for CY 2014, as the commenters suggested, because the geometric mean costs would have been based on a relatively low volume of single frequency claims and would have potentially effectuated APC and cost volatility (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74996">78 FR 74996</a>). In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we did not propose any changes to the composition of APC 0415. There were not any violations of the 2 times rule for the services assigned to APC 0415 based on claims data available for the proposed rule. The proposed geometric mean cost of APC 0415 was approximately $2,368.</p>
          <p id="p-1288" data-page="66862">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters recommended that CMS create a Level III Lower Airway Endoscopy APC and assign the procedure codes currently assigned and proposed for continued assignment to APC 0415 to this newly created APC based on geometric mean costs, procedure complexity, and clinical similarity. Specifically, one commenter recommended that CMS assign CPT code 31647 (Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with balloon occlusion, when performed, assessment of air leak, airway sizing, and insertion of bronchial valve(s), initial lobe) to the recommended Level III APC. Another commenter recommended that CMS assign CPT code 31626 (Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with placement of fiducial markers, single or multiple) to the recommended Level III APC. One commenter recommended that seven specific procedure codes be assigned to the newly created Level III APC, namely: CPT codes 31634 (Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with balloon occlusion, with assessment of air leak, with administration of occlusive substance (eg, fibrin glue), if performed), 31638 (Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with revision of tracheal or bronchial stent inserted at previous session (includes tracheal/bronchial dilation as required)), 31626, 31631<span id="page-66863" class="printed_page" data-page="66863"> </span>(Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with placement of tracheal stent(s) (includes tracheal/bronchial dilation as required)), 31636 (Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with placement of bronchial stent(s) (includes tracheal/bronchial dilation as required), initial bronchus), 31660 (Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with bronchial thermoplasty, 1 lobe), and 31661 (Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with bronchial thermoplasty, 2 or more lobes).

          <p id="p-1289" data-page="66863">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We believe that there is considerable clinical similarity in regard to the procedures assigned to APC 0415. All of the procedures are lower airway bronchoscopy procedures and are generally clinically more complex than the lower airway endoscopy procedures assigned to APC 0076 (Level I Endoscopy Lower Airway). We do not believe that the range of costs for the significant procedures assigned to APC 0415 warrants the creation of a Level III lower airway endoscopy APC. The final rule geometric mean cost for APC 0415 is approximately $2,341. Several of the procedures that the commenters recommended for assignment to the recommended Level III APC have final rule geometric mean costs comparable to the geometric mean cost of APC 0415. For CY 2015, CPT code 31634 has a final geometric mean cost of approximately $1,539; CPT code 31638 has a final geometric mean cost of approximately $2,320; and CPT code 31626 has a final geometric mean cost of approximately $2,897. The other CPT codes recommended by the commenters have somewhat higher approximate geometric mean costs, namely: CPT code 31631 (which has a geometric mean cost of approximately $3,488), CPT code 31661 (which has a geometric mean cost of approximately $3,789), CPT code 31660 (which has a geometric mean cost of approximately $3,840), and CPT code 31636 (which has a geometric mean cost of approximately $4,090). Assigning any of these procedures to APC 0415 does not create a violation of the 2 times rule when compared to the geometric mean cost of the lowest significant procedure assigned to this APC, CPT code 31629 (Bronchoscopy, rigid or flexible, including fluoroscopic guidance, when performed; with transbronchial needle aspiration biopsy(s), trachea, main stem and/or lobar bronchus(i)), which is approximately $2,186. Among the procedures discussed above, CPT codes 31626 and 31660 describe the only significant procedures assigned to this APC and are the procedures that we would normally apply the 2 times rule provisions. There are not any violations of the 2 times rule in regard to these procedures&apos; costs. Although CPT code 31647 has a considerably higher geometric mean cost of approximately $5,373 based on 11 single frequency claims, it is not a significant procedure. We would not reassign this procedure to another APC based on a violation of the 2 times rule. Moreover, considering the final rule claims data for the five highest cost procedures assigned to APC 0415, the total number of single frequency claims is 649. The possible composition of a Level III lower airway endoscopy APC would still be based on a low volume of claims, similar to the low volume of claims in regard to the Level III lower airway endoscopy APC recommended by the commenters in CY 2014. As we stated in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, a low-volume APC would contribute to the APC&apos;s cost volatility, which in turn contributes to payment volatility for the procedures assigned to the low-volume APC (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74996">78 FR 74996</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-1290" data-page="66863">After consideration of the public comments we received regarding the composition of APC 0415, we are finalizing our proposal to continue the assignment of the procedure codes that have been historically assigned to APC 0415 for CY 2015. However, for CY 2016, we will explore possible changes to the lower airway endoscopy APCs as a part of our broader efforts to thoroughly review, revise, and consolidate APCs to improve both clinical and resource homogeneity.

Other commenters suggested that CMS reassign CPT code 15110 to APC 0328 (Level III Skin Procedures), which has a proposed CY 2015 payment rate of approximately $1,408. The commenters believed that APC 0328 has clinically similar procedures and is more comparable to the geometric mean costs of CPT code 15110. Another commenter believed that the low volume of claims data for CPT code 15110 is attributable to providers and hospitals miscoding the performance of the service by not including the cost of the device.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We reviewed the historical claims data for CPT code 15110, dating<span id="page-66864" class="printed_page" data-page="66864"> </span>back to CY 2008, which is the first year that claims data for this code became available. As listed in Table 23 below, for CY 2008 through CY 2013, the payment rate for CPT code 15110 has ranged between $288.30 and $393.38 based on a range of single claims between 3 and 8. In addition, for the CY 2014 update, which was based on hospital outpatient claims data that were submitted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, and processed on or before June 30, 2013, the payment rate for CPT code 15110 was significantly higher (approximately $2,260.46) based on 10 single claims. However, as has been our practice since the implementation of the OPPS in 2000, we review, on an annual basis, the APC assignments for the procedures and services paid under the OPPS. Based on the latest hospital outpatient claims data used for this final rule with comment period, our analysis does not support the continued assignment of CPT code 15110 to APC 0329, which is the APC to which the procedure was assigned during CY 2014, or the suggested APC 0328. We examined the latest hospital outpatient claims data for CPT code 15110 for dates of service between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, that were processed on or before June 30, 2014. Our analysis of the claims data shows a geometric mean cost for CPT code 15110 of approximately $748 based on 127 single claims (out of 165 total claims). We do not believe that APC 0328 is the most appropriate APC assignment because the geometric mean cost for this APC is approximately $1,460, which is significantly higher than the geometric mean cost for CPT code 15110, which is approximately $748. Assigning CPT code 15110 to APC 0328 would result in an overpayment for the service provided. We believe that APC 0327 is the most appropriate APC assignment for CPT code 15110 based on clinical homogeneity to the other skin-related procedures assigned to this APC.</p>

          <p id="p-1298" data-page="66864">Further, based on our analysis of the CY 2013 hospital outpatient claims data used for this final rule with comment period, we are unable to determine whether hospitals are miscoding claims reporting this service. For all APCs whose payment rates are based upon relative payment weights, we note that the quality and accuracy of reported units and charges influence the geometric mean costs that are the basis for our payment rates, especially for low-volume items and services. Beyond our standard OPPS trimming methodology (described in section II.A.2. of this final rule with comment period) that we apply to those claims that have passed various types of claims processing edits, it is not our general policy to determine the accuracy of hospital coding and charging practices for purposes of ratesetting (<a href="/citation/75-FR-71838">75 FR 71838</a>). We rely on hospitals to bill all HCPCS codes accurately in accordance with their code descriptors and CPT and CMS instructions, as applicable, and to report charges on claims and charges and costs on their Medicare hospital cost report appropriately. In addition, we do not specify the methodologies that hospitals must use to set charges for this or any other service.</p>
          <p id="p-1299" data-page="66864">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal, without modification, to reassign CPT code 15110 to APC 0327 for CY 2015. The final payment rate for CPT code 15110 can be found in Addendum B to this final rule with comment period, which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Image-Guided Breast Biopsy Procedures and Image-Guided Abscess Drainage Procedures (APCs 0005 and 0007)</b></p>
          <p id="p-1300" data-page="66864">For the CY 2014 OPPS update, the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel deleted the image-guided breast biopsy CPT codes 19102 and 19103 and replaced these procedure codes with six new CPT codes that &#x201C;bundled&#x201D; payment for associated imaging services, effective January 1, 2014. As shown in Table 23 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40983">79 FR 40983</a>), CPT codes 19102 and 19103 described percutaneous image-guided breast biopsies using specific devices. Specifically, CPT code 19102 described a breast biopsy performed using a core needle, and CPT code 19103 described a breast biopsy performed using either a vacuum-assisted or rotating device.</p>
          <p id="p-1301" data-page="66864">In CY 2013, to appropriately report the performance of an image-guided breast biopsy using a core needle, an automated vacuum-assisted device, or a rotating biopsy device, multiple procedure codes were required to identify the specific service performed. That is, a procedure code describing the device-related breast biopsy procedure was required to be reported in combination with the procedure code describing the localization device used during the procedures, as well as the specific image-guidance procedure codes describing the imaging service. Table 23 of the proposed rule showed how image-guided breast biopsy procedures were reported prior to CY 2014. Table 23 of the proposed rule also showed the CY 2013 OPPS status indicators, APC assignments, and payment rates for the breast biopsy procedure codes, the localization devices used during the procedures, and the specific image-guidance procedure codes describing the imaging service.</p>

          <p id="p-1302" data-page="66864">For the CY 2014 OPPS update, the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel grouped the multiple procedures that describe these imaging services into single comprehensive service codes; specifically, CPT codes 19081, 19082, 19083, 19084, 19085, and 19086. Table 24 of the proposed rule showed the six new CPT codes that replaced obsolete CPT codes 19102 and 19103. These comprehensive breast biopsy procedure codes are differentiated based on the use of specific imaging-guidance devices&#x2014;specifically imaging services performed using stereotactic guidance, ultrasound<span id="page-66865" class="printed_page" data-page="66865"> </span>guidance, or magnetic-resonance guidance.</p>
          <p id="p-1303" data-page="66865">As has been our practice since the implementation of the OPPS in 2000, we review all new procedure codes before assigning the codes to an APC. Consistent with our longstanding policy for the treatment of new codes, we assigned these new replacement CPT codes to interim APCs for CY 2014. Based on our understanding of the resources required to furnish the service as defined in the code descriptor, as well as input from our medical advisors, we assigned replacement CPT codes 19081, 19083, and 19085 to APC 0005 (Level II Needle Biopsy/Aspiration Except Bone Marrow) for the CY 2014 OPPS update. In addition, we assigned new CPT codes 19081, 19083, and 19085 to comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; in Addendum B to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (which is available via the CMS Web site) to indicate that the codes were new with an interim APC assignment that was subject to public comment. We note that, for the CY 2014 OPPS update, we finalized our policy to package all add-on codes (except those for drug administration), effective January 1, 2014. Consequently, payment for replacement CPT codes 19082, 19084, and 19086, which describe add-on procedures, was packaged for CY 2014.</p>
          <p id="p-1304" data-page="66865">At the Panel&apos;s March 10, 2014 meeting, one presenter requested that CMS reassign comprehensive CPT codes 19081, 19083, and 19085 from APC 0005 (Level II Needle Biopsy/Aspiration Except Bone Marrow), which has a CY 2014 OPPS payment rate of $702.08, to APC 0037 (Level IV Needle Biopsy/Aspiration Except Bone Marrow), which has a CY 2014 OPPS payment rate of $1,223.25. The presenter indicated that it is inappropriate to combine all of the new replacement CPT codes into one APC without regard for the imaging modality or device used to perform the procedure. The presenter also requested that CMS maintain the historic assignment of the predecessor CPT codes cost data until claims data become available for the new comprehensive CPT codes. The Panel agreed with the presenter and recommended that CMS reassign the new replacement comprehensive CPT codes, as the presenter suggested.</p>
          <p id="p-1305" data-page="66865">In light of the public presentation, the Panel&apos;s recommendation, and our longstanding policy of reviewing, on an annual basis, the APC assignments for all services and items paid under the OPPS, we evaluated the geometric mean costs associated with all of the procedures assigned to the existing four needle biopsy APCs, specifically, APCs 0004 (Level I Needle Biopsy/Aspiration Except Bone Marrow), 0005, 0685 (Level III Needle Biopsy/Aspiration Except Bone Marrow), and 0037. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40984">79 FR 40984</a>), based on our review of the latest hospital outpatient claims data available for the proposed rule, we proposed to reassign all of the procedures assigned to APCs 0685 and 0037 to either APC 0004 or APC 0005 based on clinical and resource homogeneity. If CMS finalizes this proposed revision, there would be no procedures assigned to APCs 0685 or 0037. Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40984">79 FR 40984</a>), we proposed to delete APCs 0685 and 0037 for CY 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-1306" data-page="66865">Consequently, for the CY 2015 OPPS update, we proposed to only use two needle biopsy APCs, specifically, APCs 0004 and 0005. The proposed reassignment of all of the procedures assigned to APCs 0685 and 0037 results in increased payment rates for both APCs 0004 and 0005. For CY 2015, the proposed payment rate for APC 0004 is approximately $494, which is 20 percent higher than the CY 2014 OPPS payment rate of approximately $411. Similarly, the proposed payment rate for APC 0005 is approximately $1,062, which is 51 percent higher than the CY 2014 OPPS payment rate of approximately $702. Therefore, we proposed to continue to assign CPT codes 19081, 19083, and 19085 to APC 0005 for the CY 2015 OPPS update (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40985">79 FR 40985</a>). In addition, we proposed to continue to package payment for add-on CPT codes 19082, 19084, and 19086 under the OPPS for CY 2015, consistent with our packaging policy for add-on codes that was implemented on January 1, 2014. Because we proposed to delete APC 0037 we believe that the proposed increased payment rate for APC 0005 is consistent with the Panel&apos;s recommendation to reassign CPT codes 19081, 19083, and 19085 to an appropriate APC based on resource utilization and clinical coherence.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Commenters supported CMS&apos; proposal to continue to assign CPT codes 19081, 19083, and 19085 to APC 0005. The commenters stated that the assignment of these CPT codes to APC 0005 is clinically coherent and more accurately captures the resource cost associated with providing these services when compared to the CY 2014 APC assignment.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Some commenters expressed concern regarding the inadequate payment for ancillary services associated with multiple biopsies that may be performed on the same date of service. The commenters indicated that patients sometimes present with multiple lesions, which requires a biopsy of each lesion. According to the commenters, prior to the establishment of the comprehensive CY 2014 breast biopsy CPT codes, hospitals would report each biopsy, imaging guidance, and marker or localization placements separately. The commenters requested that CMS provide guidance on how to report multiple biopsies performed on the same date of service.</p>
          <p id="p-1310" data-page="66865">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We expect hospitals to report the performance of breast biopsies using the comprehensive breast biopsy CPT codes, consistent with the latest CPT coding guidelines. As stated in the CY 2014 CPT code book, image-guided breast biopsies, including the placement of localization devices when performed, are reported using the comprehensive breast biopsy CPT codes 19081 through 19086. Image-guided placement of localization devices without the performance of a biopsy are required to be reported using CPT codes 19281 through 19288. In addition, when more than one biopsy is performed using the same imaging modality, hospitals are required to report each biopsy using an add-on code. However, if more than one biopsy is performed using different imaging modalities, hospitals are required to report a separate primary code for each additional imaging modality.</p>
          <p id="p-1311" data-page="66865">We note that it is extremely important that hospitals use all of the required HCPCS codes to report the performance of all services they furnish, consistent with the code descriptors, CPT and/or CMS instructions, and correct coding principles, whether payment for the services is made separately or packaged. The accuracy of the OPPS payment rates depends on the quality and completeness of the claims data that hospitals submit for the services they furnish to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>

          <p id="p-1312" data-page="66865">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal to continue to assign CPT codes 19081, 19083, and 19085 to APC 0005 for CY 2015.

          <p id="p-1313" data-page="66866">In addition to the proposal to maintain the APC assignment of the breast biopsy comprehensive CPT codes to APC 0005, we also discussed in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule our proposal to reassign CPT code 10030 from APC 0006 (Level I Incision &amp; Drainage) to APC 0007 (Level II Incision and Drainage). We note that, for the CY 2014 OPPS update, the AMA&apos;s CPT Editorial Panel established CPT code 10030 to report the bundled service of image-guided fluid collection drainage by catheter for percutaneous soft tissue, and CPT code 49407 to report the bundled service of image-guided fluid collection drainage by catheter for peritoneal, retroperitoneal, transvaginal or transrectal collections, effective January 1, 2014. As shown in Table 25 of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, which showed the long descriptors for CPT codes 10030 and 49407, and as listed in Addendum B to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we assigned CPT code 10030 to APC 0006, with a payment rate of $159.66 and CPT code 49407 to APC 0685, with a payment rate of $757.76. As listed in Addendum B to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, both procedure codes were assigned to comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; to indicate that the codes were new codes and assigned interim APC and status indicator assignments that were subject to public comment.</p>

          <p id="p-1314" data-page="66866">At the Panel&apos;s March 10, 2014 meeting, one presenter requested that CMS reassign CPT codes 10030 and 49407 from APC 0006 and APC 0685, respectively, to APC 0037 (Level IV Needle Biopsy/Aspiration Except Bone Marrow), which has a CY 2014 OPPS payment rate of $1,223.25. The<span id="page-66867" class="printed_page" data-page="66867"> </span>commenter noted that similar procedures also are assigned to APC 0037. Specifically, the presenter indicated that all the image-guided fluid collection drainage procedures should be treated as one clinically cohesive group and assigned to APC 0037. The Panel agreed with the presenter and recommended that CMS reassign CPT code 49407 to APC 0037. However, the Panel did not agree with the presenter that CPT code 10030 would be more appropriately assigned to APC 0037. Rather, the Panel believed that the most appropriate APC assignment for CPT code 10030 would be APC 0007. We agreed with the Panel&apos;s recommendation that CPT code 10030 should be assigned to APC 0007. Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40986">79 FR 40986</a>), we proposed to reassign CPT code 10030 from APC 0006 to APC 0007 for the CY 2015 OPPS update. In light of the Panel&apos;s recommendation to reassign CPT code 49407 and the image-guided breast biopsy procedures to APC 0037 and APC 0007, respectively, and our longstanding policy of reviewing, on an annual basis, the APC assignments for all services and items paid under the OPPS, we evaluated the geometric mean costs associated with the procedures assigned to the existing four needle biopsy APCs, as previously stated, and proposed to reassign the procedures assigned to APCs 0685 and 0037 to either APC 0004 or APC 0005 based on clinical and resource homogeneity and to delete APCs 0685 and 0037 for CY 2015. Specifically, we proposed to reassign CPT code 49407 from APC 0685 to APC 0005 for CY 2015, and to delete APCs 0037 and 0685. Table 25 of the proposed rule also showed the long descriptors for CPT codes 10030 and 49407, and their proposed status indicator and APC assignments for the CY 2015 OPPS update. The proposed CY 2015 payment rate for CPT codes 10030 and 49407 can be found in Addendum B to this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site).</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> In light of the Panel&apos;s recommendation to reassign the procedure to APC 0007 and because CPT code 10030 is a new code for CY 2014, we are not accepting the commenters&apos; suggestion to assign this procedure to APC 0005. Rather, we are reassigning CPT code 10030 from APC 0006 to APC 0007 for the CY 2015 OPPS update, as recommended by the Panel. We note that we will have CY 2014 hospital claims data available for CPT codes 10030 and 49407 in preparation for the CY 2016 OPPS rulemaking. At that time, we will reevaluate the APC assignments for all the abscess drainage CPT codes.</p>

In addition, we are finalizing our proposal to reassign the procedures assigned to APCs 0685 and 0037 to either APC 0004 or APC 0005 based on clinical and resource homogeneity. Because there would be no other procedures assigned to APCs 0685 and 0037 as a result of this reassignment, we are finalizing our proposal to delete APCs 0685 and 0037 for CY 2015.

          <p id="p-1318" data-page="66867">For CY 2015, we proposed to assign all of the NPWT services to APC 0015 (Level II Debridement &amp; Destruction), with a proposed payment rate of $141.66. We proposed to continue to assign CPT code 97606 (Negative pressure wound therapy (eg, vacuum assisted drainage collection), including topical application(s), wound assessment, and instruction(s) for ongoing care, per session; total wound(s) surface area greater than 50 square centimeters) to APC 0015. In addition, for the CY 2015 OPPS update, we proposed to reassign CPT code 97605 (Negative pressure wound therapy (eg, vacuum assisted drainage collection), including topical application(s), wound assessment, and instruction(s) for ongoing care, per session; total wound(s) surface area less than or equal to 50 square centimeters) from APC 0013 (Level II Debridement &amp; Destruction), the APC to which the procedure is assigned for CY 2014, to APC 0015. As listed in Table 29 of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40916">79 FR 40916</a>), we also proposed to reassign HCPCS codes G0456 (Negative pressure wound therapy (e.g. vacuum assisted drainage collection) using a mechanically-powered device, not durable medical equipment, including provision of cartridge and dressing(s), topical application(s), wound assessment, and instructions for ongoing care, per session; total wounds(s) surface area less than or equal to 50 square centimeters) and G0457 (Negative pressure wound therapy (e.g. vacuum assisted drainage collection) using a mechanically-powered device, not durable medical equipment, including provision of cartridge and dressing(s), topical application(s), wound assessment, and instructions for ongoing care, per session; total wounds(s) surface area greater than 50 square centimeters) from APC 0016 (Level III Debridement &amp; Destruction) to APC 0015.</p>
          <p id="p-1319" data-page="66867">We note that CPT codes 97605 and 97606 became effective on January 1, 2005, and describe the type of NPWT services that employ durable medical equipment (DME). Alternatively, HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457, which are relatively new codes that became effective on January 1, 2013, were established by CMS to provide a payment mechanism for NPWT services furnished using disposable supplies instead of DME. We proposed to maintain the assignment of status indicator &#x201C;T&#x201D; to these two codes.</p>
          <p id="p-1320" data-page="66867">For the CY 2013 OPPS update, we assigned CPT code 97605 to APC 0013 (Level II Debridement &amp; Destruction), with a payment rate of $71.54 and CPT code 97606 to APC 0015 (Level III Debridement &amp; Destruction), with a payment rate of $106.96. In addition, we assigned HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 to APC 0016 (Level IV Debridement &amp; Destruction), with a payment rate of $209.65.</p>

          <p id="p-1321" data-page="66867">For the CY 2014 OPPS update, we continued to assign CPT code 97605 to APC 0013 and CPT code 97606 to APC 0015. We also continued to assign HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 to APC 0016, with a payment rate of $274.81. We note that we stated in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75001">78 FR 75001</a>) that some commenters requested the reassignment of HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 to a higher paying APC, with a payment rate specifically ranging between $450 and $500. The commenters believed that a higher paying APC would be more reflective of the cost of providing NPWT services using disposable supplies. We further stated that because HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 were new codes for the CY 2013 OPPS update, we expected to have claims data available for these codes during the CY 2015 rulemaking cycle and, at that time, we would reevaluate the APC assignments for these services in preparation for the CY 2015 OPPS update.<span id="page-66868" class="printed_page" data-page="66868"> </span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-1322" data-page="66868">For the CY 2015 OPPS update, we analyzed the latest hospital outpatient claims data available for the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, which was based on claims submitted between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013, and processed on or before December 31, 2013. The data indicated that the geometric mean cost of APC 0013 was comparable to the geometric mean cost of APC 0015. Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40988">79 FR 40988</a>), we proposed to combine these APCs by reassigning all of the procedures from APC 0013 to APC 0015; delete APC 0013, and retain APC 0015 for the CY 2015 OPPS update. In addition, we proposed to rename the Debridement and Destruction APC series (excluding APC 0012) as follows: APC 0015 (Level II Debridement and Destruction); APC 0016 (Level III Debridement and Destruction); and APC 0017 (Level IV Debridement and Destruction).</p>
          <p id="p-1323" data-page="66868">Furthermore, the CY 2013 claims data available for the proposed rule also indicated that the geometric mean cost for HCPCS code G0456 was approximately $152 based on 4,509 single claims (out of 5,772 total claims), and approximately $193 for HCPCS code G0457 based on 386 single claims (out of 591 total claims). The claims data also showed that the geometric mean cost for CPT code 97605 was approximately $101 based on 58,901 single claims (out of 75,378 total claims), and approximately $140 for CPT code 97606 based on 6,722 single claims (out of 9,063 total claims). The proposed geometric mean costs of HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457, and CPT codes 97605 and 97606 were all comparable to the proposed geometric mean cost for APC 0015 of approximately $148. Based on analysis of the most recent claims data available for the proposed rule, we stated that we believed that the most appropriate assignment for all of the NPWT services was APC 0015 based on the clinical and resource homogeneity of the services assigned to this APC. The next higher cost APC in the series, APC 0016, had a proposed geometric mean cost of approximately $284, which was significantly higher than the proposed geometric mean cost of any of the NPWT services. Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we proposed to continue to assign CPT code 97606 to APC 0015, reassign CPT code 97605 from APC 0013 to APC 0015, and reassign HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 from APC 0016 to APC 0015 for the CY 2015 OPPS update.</p>
          <p id="p-1324" data-page="66868">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Most commenters requested that CMS continue to assign the disposable NPWT HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 to APC 0016 for the CY 2015 OPPS update, which is the same APC to which these services are assigned for CY 2014. The commenters believed that hospitals may have miscoded claims reporting these services and, consequently, the CY 2015 proposed payment rate of approximately $142 for HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 is insufficient because the CY 2013 OPPS claims data do not accurately capture the cost of the disposable supplies that is included in providing the service. One commenter stated that the cost of the disposable NPWT supplies range between $200 and $700 per case. The commenter provided copies of individual invoices that were forwarded to various hospitals from the manufacturer that showed a cost of approximately $220 for one disposable NPWT system. In addition, based on its analysis of charges reported by hospitals, the commenter believed that hospitals failed to understand the differences between the type of NPWT services that employ DME, which are described by CPT codes 97605 and 97606, and the type of disposable NPWT services described by HCPCS G-codes. The commenter stated that, according to its data analysis, there was no difference in hospital charges for the two types of NPWT services reported on claims. The commenter believed that hospitals miscoded these claims because they may have believed that the services described by the CPT codes for the type of NPWT services that use DME are similar to the services described by the disposable NPWT HCPCS G-codes. Several commenters explained that the cost of the type of NPWT services that use DME does not include the cost of the devices and supplies that are used to provide the services described by the HCPCS G-codes. The commenter speculated that, although it appeared that hospitals did not include the cost of the disposable devices when reporting their charges for the services described by the disposable NPWT HCPCS G-codes, hospitals should have included such costs. Therefore, the commenters urged CMS to continue to assign HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 to APC 0016 for the CY 2015 OPPS update.</p>
          <p id="p-1325" data-page="66868">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Based on the significant number of claims that are available for this final rule with comment period, we believe that APC 0015 best reflects the clinical characteristics and resource costs of HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457. In addition, we do not believe that continuing to assign HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 to APC 0016 would be appropriate for CY 2015. Our analysis of the latest hospital outpatient claims data available for this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, which is based on claims submitted between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013, and processed on or before June 30, 2014, indicates that the geometric mean costs for both HCPCS codes (G0456 and G0457) are very similar to the geometric mean cost of APC 0015. Specifically, our latest hospital outpatient claims data for this final rule with comment period show a geometric mean cost of approximately $158 for HCPCS code G0456 based on 5,198 single claims (out of 6,645 total claims), which is close to the geometric mean cost of APC 0015, which is approximately $152. Similarly, our claims data show a geometric mean cost of approximately $202 for HCPCS code G0457 based on 476 single claims (out of 676 total claims), which is also closer to the geometric mean cost of APC 0015, which is approximately $152 than the geometric mean cost of APC 0016, which is approximately $294.</p>

          <p id="p-1326" data-page="66868">In addition, we are not convinced that hospitals are reporting the same charges for the two types of NPWT services (DME-based and disposable) because a review of the latest claims data shows that the geometric mean costs for the most highly utilized procedures described by HCPCS code G0456 (geometric mean cost of approximately $158) and CPT code 97605 (geometric mean cost of approximately $101) are significantly different. This difference in costs captured in the claims data demonstrates that hospitals are not reporting identical charges for the different types of NPWT services, DME and disposable-based. Furthermore, we note that for all APCs whose payment rates are based upon relative payment weights, the quality and accuracy of reported units and charges influence the geometric mean costs that are the basis for our payment rates, especially for low volume items and services. However, beyond our standard OPPS trimming methodology (described in section II.A.2. of this final rule with comment period) that we apply to those claims that have passed various types of claims processing edits, it is not our general policy to judge the accuracy of hospital coding and charging for purposes of ratesetting (<a href="/citation/75-FR-71838">75 FR 71838</a>). We rely on hospitals to bill all HCPCS codes accurately in accordance with their code descriptors and CPT and CMS instructions, as applicable, and to report charges on claims and charges and costs on their Medicare hospital cost reports appropriately. In addition, we do not specify the methodologies that hospitals<span id="page-66869" class="printed_page" data-page="66869"> </span>must use to set charges for this or any other service. Therefore, based on the latest hospital outpatient claims data available for this final rule with comment period, we believe that APC 0015 best reflects the clinical characteristics and resource costs of HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457.</p>
          <p id="p-1327" data-page="66869">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter recommended that CMS make certain changes to APCs 0015 and 0016. Specifically, the commenter recommended that CMS lower the geometric mean cost for APC 0016 to $190, which would result in reassigning certain codes that were in APC 0015 whose geometric mean cost met or exceeded this amount to APC 0016. This commenter stated that such reassignment would retain HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 in APC 0016.</p>
          <p id="p-1328" data-page="66869">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We believe that the proposed structures of APCs 0015 and 0016 (aside from the few code reassignments that are being made for the purpose of resolving a violation of the 2 times rule in APC 0015 that are discussed below) are optimal in terms of clinical and resource homogeneity. The geometric mean cost range for significant procedures assigned to APC 0015 is between approximately $110 (for CPT code 17250) and approximately $201 (for CPT code 11100). The geometric mean cost range for significant procedures assigned to APC 0016 is between approximately $230 (for CPT code 17282) and approximately $368 (for CPT code 11043). Reassigning HCPCS code G0456 from APC 0015 to APC 0016 would either violate the 2 times rule in APC 0016 or necessitate dividing APC 0016 into two APCs, which we do not believe is appropriate or necessary. Both of these options are undesirable, especially given that the geometric mean cost of HCPCS code G0456 (approximately $158) is comparable to the geometric mean cost of APC 0015 (approximately $152).</p>
          <p id="p-1329" data-page="66869">In summary, based on the latest claims data used for this final rule with comment period, we believe that HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 are appropriately assigned in APC 0015 for the CY 2015 update based on the clinical and resource similarity to the other procedures in APC 0015. As has been our practice since the implementation of the OPPS in 2000, we review, on an annual basis, the APC assignments for the procedures and services paid under the OPPS. We will again review the APC assignments for all the NPWT services in light of the CY 2014 claims data and the proposed APC structures for clinically relevant APCs and determine whether an APC reassignment for any of the NPWT codes would be appropriate in the CY 2016 rulemaking.</p>
          <p id="p-1330" data-page="66869">In addition, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, there were violations of the 2 times rule noted for both APCs 0012 and 0015 (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40981">79 FR 40981</a>). Every year we make every effort to minimize the number of APCs that are listed as exceptions to the 2 times rule. To resolve the violations of the 2 times rule in APCs 0012 and 0015, we are making the following code reassignments:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1331" data-page="66869"> CPT codes 11719, 11720, 11721, 11740, and 17340, and HCPCS code G0127 from APC 0012 to APC 0340.</li>
          <li id="p-1332" data-page="66869"> CPT codes 11901, 12014, 96920, and 97605 from APC 0015 to APC 0012.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-1333" data-page="66869">These code reassignments eliminated the 2 times rule violations that existed in APCs 0012 and 0015 in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. We note that APC 0012 is one of the APCs included in the ancillary services packaging policy that is discussed in section II.A.3.c.(1) of this final rule with comment period. Because CPT code 97605 is assigned to APC 0012, the code will be conditionally packaged and assigned to status indicator &#x201C;Q1&#x201D; for CY 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-1334" data-page="66869">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our CY 2015 proposal, with modification. Specifically, we are finalizing our proposal to assign CPT code 97606 and HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 to APC 0015. However, we are reassigning CPT code 97605 from our proposed APC 0015 to APC 0012 for the CY 2015 update to eliminate the violation of the 2 times rule that existed in APC 0015 based on claims data available for the proposed rule.</p>
          <p id="p-1335" data-page="66869">In addition, for the CY 2015 update, the CPT Editorial Panel established two new CPT codes to describe disposable NPWT services and revised the long descriptors for existing CPT codes 97605 and 97606, effective January 1, 2015. Consistent with our general policy of using permanent codes rather than using temporary HCPCS G-codes in order to streamline coding, we are deleting HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 because they are replaced with two new CPT codes effective January 1, 2015. Table 25 below shows the replacement CPT codes for HCPCS codes G0456 and G0457 as well as the revised long descriptors for existing CPT codes 97605 and 97606. The final CY 2015 payment rate for the NPWT services codes can be found in Addendum B to this final rule with comment period (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site). Like all new codes effective January 1, 2015, the APC assignments for the new disposable NPWT CPT codes are open for comment for 60 days after display of this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter requested that CMS exempt HCPCS code G0460 from the geographic wage index variations to enable hospitals to more willingly participate in the AutoloGel Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) protocols. According to the commenter, HOPDs are reluctant to enroll in the CED protocols because they are concerned that the proposed APC payment rate will not cover the cost of the product, the procedure, the overhead, and the additional administrative effort associated with CED data collection requirements. In addition, the commenter requested that CMS establish a final payment rate for APC 0327 based on the geometric mean cost of $496.99 to help achieve some stability regarding the payment for the procedures assigned to this APC.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We note that comments related to CED protocols or data collection are outside the scope of the proposed rule. With regard to the geographic wage index exemption requested by the commenter, we have never made such an exception. Under the hospital OPPS, all procedures and services that include devices are wage adjusted. Moreover, the payment rates for procedures and APCs are not based on a specific projected amount. The final payment rate for APC 0327 is based on the geometric mean cost of all the procedures described by the HCPCS codes assigned to this APC. We believe that the procedure described by HCPCS code G0460 is appropriately assigned to APC 0327 for the CY 2015 OPPS update based on the clinical and resource similarities in relation to the other procedures assigned to APC 0327. We note that, for this final rule with comment period, which is based on hospital outpatient claims submitted between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, that were processed on or before June 30, 2014, our latest hospital outpatient claims data show no claims reporting the service described by HCPCS code G0460. As has been our practice since the implementation of the OPPS in 2000, we review, on an annual basis, the APC assignments for the procedures and services paid under the OPPS. We will review the APC assignment for HCPCS code G0460 when sufficient claims data become available to determine whether a reassignment to a more appropriate APC is necessary for the CY 2016 update. After consideration of the public comment we received, we are finalizing our proposal, without modification, to continue to assign HCPCS code G0460 to APC 0327 for CY 2015. The final CY 2015 payment rate for HCPCS code G0460 can be found in Addendum B to this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site).</p>

<h4><a name="134"></a>A. OPPS Transitional Pass-Through Payment for Additional Costs of Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Background</b></p>
          <p id="p-1363" data-page="66874">Section 1833(t)(6) of the Act provides for temporary additional payments or &#x201C;transitional pass-through payments&#x201D; for certain drugs and biologicals. Throughout this final rule with comment period, the term &#x201C;biological&#x201D; is used because this is the term that appears in section 1861(t) of the Act. &#x201C;Biological&#x201D; as used in this final rule with comment period includes &#x201C;biological product&#x201D; or &#x201C;biologic&#x201D; as defined in the Public Health Service Act. As enacted by the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) (<a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=106&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=113&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub. L. 106-113</a>), this provision requires the Secretary to make additional payments to hospitals for: current orphan drugs, as designated under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; current drugs and biologicals and brachytherapy sources used in cancer therapy; and current radiopharmaceutical drugs and biologicals. &#x201C;Current&#x201D; refers to drugs or biologicals that are outpatient hospital services under Medicare Part B for which payment was made on the first date the hospital OPPS was implemented.</p>
          <p id="p-1364" data-page="66874">Transitional pass-through payments also are provided for certain &#x201C;new&#x201D; drugs and biologicals that were not being paid for as an HOPD service as of December 31, 1996 and whose cost is &#x201C;not insignificant&#x201D; in relation to the OPPS payments for the procedures or services associated with the new drug or biological. For pass-through payment purposes, radiopharmaceuticals are included as &#x201C;drugs.&#x201D; As required by statute, transitional pass-through payments for a drug or biological described in section 1833(t)(6)(C)(i)(II) of the Act can be made for a period of at least 2 years, but not more than 3 years, after the payment was first made for the product as a hospital outpatient service under Medicare Part B. CY 2015 pass-through drugs and biologicals and their designated APCs are assigned status indicator &#x201C;G&#x201D; in Addenda A and B to this final rule with comment period, which are available via the Internet on the CMS Web site.</p>
          <p id="p-1365" data-page="66874">Section 1833(t)(6)(D)(i) of the Act specifies that the pass-through payment amount, in the case of a drug or biological, is the amount by which the amount determined under section 1842(o) of the Act for the drug or biological exceeds the portion of the otherwise applicable Medicare OPD fee schedule that the Secretary determines is associated with the drug or biological. If the drug or biological is covered under a competitive acquisition contract under section 1847B of the Act, the pass-through payment amount is determined by the Secretary to be equal to the average price for the drug or biological for all competitive acquisition areas and the year established under such section as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary. However, we note that the Part B drug competitive acquisition program (CAP) has been postponed since CY 2009, and such a program has not been reinstated for CY 2015.</p>

          <p id="p-1366" data-page="66874">This methodology for determining the pass-through payment amount is set forth in regulations at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-419.64">42 CFR 419.64</a>. These regulations specify that the pass-through payment equals the amount determined under section 1842(o) of the Act minus the portion of the APC payment that CMS determines is associated with the drug or biological. Section 1847A of the Act establishes the average sales price (ASP) methodology, which is used for payment for drugs and biologicals described in section 1842(o)(1)(C) of the Act furnished on or after January 1, 2005. The ASP methodology, as applied under the OPPS, uses several sources of data as a basis for payment, including the ASP, the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), and the average wholesale price (AWP). In this final rule with comment period, the term &#x201C;ASP methodology&#x201D; and &#x201C;ASP-based&#x201D; are inclusive of all data sources and methodologies described therein. Additional information on the ASP methodology can be found on the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Part-B-Drugs/McrPartBDrugAvgSalesPrice/index.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Part-B-Drugs/McrPartBDrugAvgSalesPrice/index.html</a></i>.</p>

          <p id="p-1367" data-page="66874">The pass-through application and review process for drugs and biologicals is explained on the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/passthrough_payment.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/passthrough_payment.html</a></i>.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Drugs and Biologicals With Expiring Pass-Through Payment Status in CY 2014</b></p>
          <p id="p-1368" data-page="66874">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40992">79 FR 40992</a>), we proposed that the pass-through status of 9 drugs and biologicals would expire on December 31, 2014, as listed in Table 33 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40993">79 FR 40993</a>). All of these drugs and biologicals will have received OPPS pass-through payment for at least 2 years and no more than 3 years by December 31, 2014. These drugs and biologicals were approved for pass-through status on or before January 1, 2013. With the exception of those groups of drugs and biologicals that are always packaged when they do not have pass-through status (specifically, diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals; contrast agents; anesthesia drugs; drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals that function as supplies when used in a diagnostic test or procedure; and drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure), our standard methodology for providing payment for drugs and biologicals with expiring pass-through status in an upcoming calendar year is to determine the product&apos;s estimated per day cost and compare it with the OPPS drug packaging threshold for that calendar year (which is $95 for CY 2015), as discussed further in section V.B.2. of this final rule with comment period. If the estimated per day cost for the drug or biological is less than or equal to the applicable OPPS drug packaging threshold, we would package payment for the drug or biological into the payment for the associated procedure in the upcoming calendar year. If the estimated per day cost of the drug or biological is greater than the OPPS drug packaging threshold, we would provide separate payment at the applicable relative ASP-based payment amount (which is ASP+6 percent for CY 2015, as discussed further in section V.B.3. of this final rule with comment period).</p>
          <p id="p-1369" data-page="66874">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Commenters, including several hospitals, physicians, and a manufacturer, requested that CMS continue to pay separately for Exparel&#xAE; (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) described by HCPCS code C9290 (Injection, bupivicaine liposome, 1 mg) once pass-through payment status expires on December 31, 2014. Commenters disagreed with CMS&apos; proposal to package Exparel&#xAE; as a surgical supply and stated that the drug is used to control postoperative pain and is not used in the actual surgical procedure. In addition, commenters noted that the product cost of Exparel&#xAE; exceeds the proposed CY 2015 packaging threshold of $90 and is not FDA-approved as a local anesthetic.</p>
          <p id="p-1370" data-page="66874">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We disagree with the commenters&apos; characterization of Exparel&#xAE; as not functioning as a surgical supply because it is indicated for the alleviation of postoperative pain. The indications and usage of Exparel&#xAE; as listed in the FDA-approved label are as follows: &#x201C;Exparel&#xAE; is a liposome injection of bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, indicated for administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia.&#x201D;<span id="page-66875" class="printed_page" data-page="66875"> </span>Exparel&#xAE; is injected immediately after the surgical procedure while the patient is still on the operating room table at the surgical wound site to control postoperative pain, which is an important part of the surgical care of the patient affecting the surgical outcome. In the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74925">78 FR 74925</a> through 74939), we finalized our policy at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-419.2">42 CFR 419.2</a>(b)(16) to unconditionally package all drugs and biologicals that function as supplies in a surgical procedure. According to OPPS policy, drugs, biologicals, radiopharmaceuticals, implantable medical devices, and other items and products that are not equipment can be supplies in the OPPS (<a href="/citation/78-FR-43571">78 FR 43571</a> and 43575). While the commenter stated that the cost of Exparel&#xAE; exceeds the drug packaging threshold, we emphasize that cost consideration is not a factor in determining whether an item is a surgical supply. We consider all items related to the surgical outcome and provided during the hospital stay in which the surgery is performed, including postsurgical pain management drugs, to be part of the surgery for purposes of our drug and biological surgical supply packaging policy. Therefore, for CY 2015, we are finalizing our proposal to package Exparel&#xAE; described by HCPCS code C9290 and to assign status indicator &#x201C;N&#x201D; to the code for CY 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-1371" data-page="66875">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters recommended that CMS continue pass-through payment status for new drugs, specifically diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and contrast agents, for a full 3 years. The commenters asserted that providing pass-through payment status for 3 years would help provide a more current and accurate data set on which to base payment amounts of the procedure when the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical or contrast agent is subsequently packaged. The commenters further recommended that CMS expire pass-through payment status for drugs and biologicals on a quarterly as opposed to an annual basis.</p>
          <p id="p-1372" data-page="66875">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As we stated in the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74287">76 FR 74287</a>), the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68363">77 FR 68363</a>), and the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75010">78 FR 75010</a>), and as described in section V.A. of this final rule with comment period, section 1833(t)(6)(c)(i)(II) of the Act permits CMS to make pass-through payments for a period of at least 2 years, but not more than 3 years, after the product&apos;s first payment as a hospital outpatient service under Medicare Part B OPPS. We continue to believe that this period of payment appropriately facilitates dissemination of these new products into clinical practice and facilitates the collection of sufficient hospital claims data reflective of their costs for future OPPS ratesetting. Our longstanding practice has been to provide pass-through payment for a period of 2 to 3 years, with expiration of pass-through payment status proposed and finalized through the annual rulemaking process. Each year, when proposing to expire the pass-through payment status of certain drugs and biologicals, we examine our claims data for these products. We observe that hospitals typically have incorporated these products into their chargemasters based on the utilization and costs observed in our claims data. Under the existing pass-through payment policy, we begin pass-through payment on a quarterly basis, depending on when applications are submitted to us for consideration. We are confident that the period of time for which drugs, biologicals, contrast agents, and radiopharmaceuticals receive pass-through payment status, which is at least 2 but no more than 3 years, is appropriate for CMS to collect the sufficient amount of data to make a packaging determination.</p>
          <p id="p-1373" data-page="66875">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal, without modification, to expire the pass-through payment status of the nine drugs and biologicals listed in Table 28 below. Table 28 lists the drugs and biologicals for which pass-through payment status will expire on December 31, 2014, the status indicators, and the assigned APCs for CY 2015.</p>

          <br><p><b>3. Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals With New or Continuing Pass-Through Payment Status in CY 2015</b></p>
          <p id="p-1374" data-page="66875">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40993">79 FR 40993</a>), we proposed to continue pass-through payment status in CY 2015 for 22 drugs and biologicals. None of these drugs and biologicals will have received OPPS pass-through payment for at least 2 years and no more than 3 years by December 31, 2014. These drugs and biologicals, which were approved for pass-through status between January 1, 2013 and July 1, 2014, were listed in Table 34 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40994">79 FR 40994</a>). The APCs and HCPCS codes for these drugs and biologicals approved for pass-through status through July 1, 2014 were assigned status indicator &#x201C;G&#x201D; in Addenda A and B to the proposed rule. Addenda A and B to the proposed rule are available via the Internet on the CMS Web site.</p>

          <p id="p-1375" data-page="66875">Section 1833(t)(6)(D)(i) of the Act sets the amount of pass-through payment for pass-through drugs and biologicals (the pass-through payment amount) as the difference between the amount authorized under section 1842(o) of the Act and the portion of the otherwise applicable OPD fee schedule that the Secretary determines is associated with the drug or biological. Payment for drugs and biologicals with pass-through status under the OPPS is currently made at the physician&apos;s office payment rate of ASP+6 percent. We stated in the proposed rule that we believe it is<span id="page-66876" class="printed_page" data-page="66876"> </span>consistent with the statute to propose to continue to provide payment for drugs and biologicals with pass-through status at a rate of ASP+6 percent in CY 2015, which is the amount that drugs and biologicals receive under section 1842(o) of the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-1376" data-page="66876">Therefore, for CY 2015, we proposed to pay for pass-through drugs and biologicals at ASP+6 percent, equivalent to the rate these drugs and biologicals would receive in the physician&apos;s office setting in CY 2015. We proposed that a $0.00 pass-through payment amount would be paid for most pass-through drugs and biologicals under the CY 2015 OPPS because the difference between the amount authorized under section 1842(o) of the Act, which is ASP+6 percent, and the portion of the otherwise applicable OPD fee schedule that the Secretary determines is appropriate, proposed at ASP+6 percent, is $0.</p>
          <p id="p-1377" data-page="66876">In the case of policy-packaged drugs (which include the following: Contrast agents; diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals; anesthesia drugs; drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals that function as supplies when used in a diagnostic test or procedure and drugs; and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure), we proposed that their pass-through payment amount would be equal to ASP+6 percent for CY 2015 because, if not on pass-through status, payment for these products would be packaged into the associated procedure.</p>
          <p id="p-1378" data-page="66876">In addition, we proposed to continue to update pass-through payment rates on a quarterly basis on the CMS Web site during CY 2015 if later quarter ASP submissions (or more recent WAC or AWP information, as applicable) indicate that adjustments to the payment rates for these pass-through drugs or biologicals are necessary. For a full description of this policy, we refer readers to the CY 2006 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/70-FR-68632">70 FR 68632</a> through 68635).</p>
          <p id="p-1379" data-page="66876">In CY 2015, as is consistent with our CY 2014 policy for diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, we proposed to provide payment for both diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals that are granted pass-through payment status based on the ASP methodology. As stated above, for purposes of pass-through payment, we consider radiopharmaceuticals to be drugs under the OPPS. Therefore, if a diagnostic or therapeutic radiopharmaceutical receives pass-through payment status during CY 2015, we proposed to follow the standard ASP methodology to determine the pass-through payment rate that drugs receive under section 1842(o) of the Act, which is ASP+6 percent. If ASP data are not available for a radiopharmaceutical, we proposed to provide pass-through payment at WAC+6 percent, the equivalent payment provided to pass-through drugs and biologicals without ASP information. If WAC information also is not available, we proposed to provide payment for the pass-through radiopharmaceutical at 95 percent of its most recent AWP.</p>
          <p id="p-1380" data-page="66876">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters supported CMS&apos; proposal to provide payment at ASP+6 percent for drugs, biologicals, contrast agents, and radiopharmaceuticals that are granted pass-through payment status. A few commenters requested that CMS provide an additional payment for radiopharmaceuticals that are granted pass-through payment status.</p>
          <p id="p-1381" data-page="66876">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As discussed above, the statute provides that mandated pass-through payment for pass-through drugs and biologicals for CY 2015 equals the amount determined under section 1842(o) of the Act minus the portion of the otherwise applicable APC payment that CMS determines is associated with the drug or biological. Therefore, the pass-through payment is determined by subtracting the otherwise applicable payment amount under the OPPS (ASP+6 percent for CY 2015) from the amount determined under section 1842(o) of the Act (ASP+6 percent).</p>

          <p id="p-1382" data-page="66876">Regarding the commenters&apos; request that CMS provide an additional payment for radiopharmaceuticals that are granted pass-through payment status, we note that, for CY 2015, consistent with our CY 2014 payment policy for diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, we proposed to provide payment for both diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals with pass-through payment status based on the ASP methodology. As stated above, the ASP methodology, as applied under the OPPS, uses several sources of data as a basis for payment, including the ASP, the WAC if the ASP is unavailable, and 95 percent of the radiopharmaceutical&apos;s most recent AWP if the ASP and WAC are unavailable. For purposes of pass-through payment, we consider radiopharmaceuticals to be drugs under the OPPS. Therefore, if a diagnostic or therapeutic radiopharmaceutical receives pass-through payment status during CY 2015, we proposed to follow the standard ASP methodology to determine its pass-through payment rate under the OPPS to account for the acquisition and pharmacy overhead costs, including compounding costs. We continue to believe that a single payment is appropriate for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals with pass-through payment status in CY 2015, and that the payment rate of ASP+6 percent (or payment based on the ASP methodology) is appropriate to provide payment for both the radiopharmaceutical&apos;s acquisition cost and any associated nuclear medicine handling and compounding costs. We refer readers to section V.B.3. of this final rule with comment period for further discussion of payment for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals based on ASP information submitted by manufacturers, and readers also may refer to the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html</a></i>.</p>
          <p id="p-1383" data-page="66876">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal to provide payment for drugs, biologicals, diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, and contrast agents that are granted pass-through payment status based on the ASP methodology. If a diagnostic or therapeutic radiopharmaceutical receives pass- through status during CY 2015, we will follow the standard ASP methodology to determine the pass-through payment rate that drugs receive under section 1842(o) of the Act, which is ASP+6 percent. If ASP data are not available for a radiopharmaceutical, we will provide pass-through payment at WAC+6 percent, the equivalent payment provided to pass-through drugs and biologicals without ASP information. If WAC information also is not available, we will provide payment for the pass-through radiopharmaceutical at 95 percent of its most recent AWP.</p>

          <p id="p-1384" data-page="66876">As discussed in more detail in section II.A.3. of this final rule with comment period, we implemented a policy whereby payment for the following nonpass-through items is packaged into payment for the associated procedure: diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals; contrast agents; anesthesia drugs; drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals that function as supplies when used in a diagnostic test or procedure; and drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure. As stated earlier, pass-through payment is the difference between the amount authorized under section 1842(o) of the Act and the portion of the otherwise applicable OPD fee schedule that the Secretary determines is associated with the drug or biological. Because payment for a drug that is policy-packaged would otherwise be packaged if the product did not have pass-through payment<span id="page-66877" class="printed_page" data-page="66877"> </span>status, we believe the otherwise applicable OPPS payment amount would be equal to the policy-packaged drug APC offset amount for the associated clinical APC in which the drug or biological is utilized. The calculation of the policy-packaged drug APC offset amounts is described in more detail in section V.A.4. of this final rule with comment period. It follows that the copayment for the nonpass-through payment portion (the otherwise applicable fee schedule amount that we would also offset from payment for the drug or biological if a payment offset applies) of the total OPPS payment for those drugs and biologicals, therefore, would be accounted for in the copayment for the associated clinical APC in which the drug or biological is used.</p>
          <p id="p-1385" data-page="66877">According to section 1833(t)(8)(E) of the Act, the amount of copayment associated with pass-through items is equal to the amount of copayment that would be applicable if the pass-through adjustment was not applied. Therefore, as we did in CY 2014, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we proposed to continue to set the associated copayment amount to zero for CY 2015 for pass-through drugs and biologicals that would otherwise be packaged if the item did not have pass-through payment status. The 22 drugs and biologicals that we proposed would continue to have pass-through payment status for CY 2015 or have been granted pass-through payment status as of January 2015 were shown in Table 34 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40994">79 FR 40994</a>).</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Commenters supported the CY 2015 proposal to continue to set the associated copayment amounts for pass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and contrast agents that would otherwise be packaged if the product did not have pass-through payment status to zero. The commenters noted that this policy is consistent with statutory requirements and provides cost-saving benefits to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate the commenters&apos; support of our proposal. As discussed in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40993">79 FR 40993</a> through 40994), we believe that for drugs and biologicals that are &#x201C;policy-packaged,&#x201D; the copayment for the nonpass-through payment portion of the total OPPS payment for this subset of drugs and biologicals is accounted for in the copayment of the associated clinical APC in which the drug or biological is used. According to section 1833(t)(8)(E) of the Act, the amount of copayment associated with pass-through items is equal to the amount of copayment that would be applicable if the pass-through adjustment was not applied. Therefore, we believe that the copayment amount should be zero for drugs and biologicals that are &#x201C;policy-packaged,&#x201D; including diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and contrast agents. We also believe that the copayment amount should be zero for anesthesia drugs that would otherwise be packaged if the item did not have pass-through payment status.</p>

          <br><p><b>4. Provisions for Reducing Transitional Pass-Through Payments for Policy-Packaged Drugs and Biologicals To Offset Costs Packaged Into APC Groups</b></p>
          <br><p><b>a. Background</b></p>
          <p id="p-1390" data-page="66878">Prior to CY 2008, diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and contrast agents were paid separately under the OPPS if their mean per day costs were greater than the applicable year&apos;s drug packaging threshold. In CY 2008 (<a href="/citation/72-FR-66768">72 FR 66768</a>), we began a policy of packaging payment for all nonpass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and contrast agents as ancillary and supportive items and services into their associated nuclear medicine procedures. Therefore, beginning in CY 2008, nonpass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and contrast agents were not subject to the annual OPPS drug packaging threshold to determine their packaged or separately payable payment status, and instead all nonpass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and contrast agents were packaged as a matter of policy.</p>
          <p id="p-1391" data-page="66878">For CY 2014, in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74925">78 FR 74925</a>), we continued to package payment for all nonpass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, contrast agents, and anesthesia drugs, and we began packaging all nonpass-through drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals that function as supplies when used in a diagnostic test or procedure and drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure. These packaging policies are codified at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-419.2">42 CFR 419.2</a>(b).</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Payment Offset Policy for Diagnostic Radiopharmaceuticals</b></p>
          <p id="p-1392" data-page="66878">As previously noted, radiopharmaceuticals are considered to be drugs for OPPS pass-through payment purposes. As described above, section 1833(t)(6)(D)(i) of the Act specifies that the transitional pass-through payment amount for pass-through drugs and biologicals is the difference between the amount paid under section 1842(o) of the Act and the otherwise applicable OPD fee schedule amount. Because a payment offset is necessary in order to provide an appropriate transitional pass-through payment, we deduct from the pass-through payment for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals an amount reflecting the portion of the APC payment associated with predecessor radiopharmaceuticals in order to ensure no duplicate radiopharmaceutical payment is made.</p>
          <p id="p-1393" data-page="66878">In CY 2009, we established a policy to estimate the portion of each APC payment rate that could reasonably be attributed to the cost of predecessor diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals when considering a new diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for pass-through payment (<a href="/citation/73-FR-68638">73 FR 68638</a> through 68641). Specifically, we use the policy-packaged drug offset fraction for APCs containing nuclear medicine procedures, calculated as 1 minus the following: The cost from single procedure claims in the APC after removing the cost for policy-packaged drugs divided by the cost from single procedure claims in the APC. To determine the actual APC offset amount for pass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals that takes into consideration the otherwise applicable OPPS payment amount, we multiply the policy-packaged drug offset fraction by the APC payment amount for the nuclear medicine procedure with which the pass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceutical is used and, accordingly, reduce the separate OPPS payment for the pass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceutical by this amount. For CY 2015, as we did in CY 2014, we proposed to continue to apply the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical offset policy to payment for pass-through diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals.</p>
          <p id="p-1394" data-page="66878">There is currently one diagnostic radiopharmaceutical with pass-through status under the OPPS. HCPCS code A9520 (Technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept, diagnostic, up to 0.5 millicuries) was granted pass-through payment status beginning October 1, 2013. We currently apply the established radiopharmaceutical payment offset policy to pass-through payment for this product.</p>
          <p id="p-1395" data-page="66878">Table 35 of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40995">79 FR 40995</a>) displayed the proposed APCs to which nuclear medicine procedures would be assigned in CY 2015 and for which we expect that an APC offset could be applicable in the case of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals with pass-through status.</p>
          <p id="p-1396" data-page="66878">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters requested that CMS reinstate the &#x201C;FB&#x201D; modifier to specified nuclear medicine procedures in cases in which the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical is received at no cost or full credit. The commenters requested that the policy be maintained for CY 2015 and beyond.</p>
          <p id="p-1397" data-page="66878">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As we discussed in the CY2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75016">78 FR 75016</a>), our review of claims data showed that hospitals rarely received diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals at no cost or full credit.

Because a payment offset is necessary in order to provide an appropriate transitional pass-through payment, we deduct from the pass-through payment for contrast agents an amount reflecting the portion of the APC payment associated with predecessor contrast agents in order to ensure no duplicate contrast agent payment is made.</p>
          <p id="p-1403" data-page="66879">In CY 2010, we established a policy to estimate the portion of each APC payment rate that could reasonably be attributed to the cost of predecessor contrast agents when considering new contrast agents for pass-through payment (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60482">74 FR 60482</a> through 60484). Specifically, we use the policy-packaged drug offset fraction for procedural APCs, calculated as 1 minus the following: The cost from single procedure claims in the APC after removing the cost for policy packaged drugs divided by the cost from single procedure claims in the APC. To determine the actual APC offset amount for pass-through contrast agents that takes into consideration the otherwise applicable OPPS payment amount, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40995">79 FR 40995</a>), we proposed to multiply the policy packaged drug offset fraction by the APC payment amount for the procedure with which the pass-through contrast agent is used and, accordingly, reduce the separate OPPS payment for the pass-through contrast agent by this amount. For CY 2015, as we did in CY 2014, we proposed to continue to apply our standard contrast agents offset policy to payment for pass-through contrast agents (we refer readers to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75017">78 FR 75017</a>) for the final CY 2014 policy and the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40995">79 FR 40995</a> through 40996) for the proposed CY 2015 policy).</p>

We proposed to identify procedural APCs for which we expect a contrast offset could be applicable in the case of a pass-through contrast agent as any procedural APC with a policy-packaged drug amount greater than $20 that is not a nuclear medicine APC identified in Table 35 of the proposed rule, and these APCs were displayed in Table 36 of the proposed rule. The methodology used to determine a proposed threshold cost for application of a contrast agent offset policy is described in detail in the CY 2010 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60483">74 FR 60483</a> through 60484). For CY 2015, we proposed to continue to recognize that when a contrast agent with pass-through status is billed with any procedural APC listed in Table 36 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40995">79 FR 40995</a> through 40996), a specific offset based on the procedural APC would be applied to payment for the contrast agent to ensure that duplicate payment is not made for the contrast agent.</p>

<h4><a name="143"></a>B. OPPS Payment for Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals Without Pass-Through Payment Status</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Background</b></p>

          <p id="p-1412" data-page="66880">Under the CY 2013 OPPS, we currently pay for drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals that do not have pass-through payment status in one of two ways: as a packaged payment included in the payment for the associated service, or as a separate payment (individual APCs). We explained in the April 7, 2000 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/65-FR-18450">65 FR 18450</a>) that we generally package the cost of drugs and radiopharmaceuticals into the APC payment rate for the procedure or treatment with which the products are usually furnished. Hospitals do not receive separate payment for packaged items and supplies, and hospitals may not bill beneficiaries separately for any packaged items and supplies whose costs are recognized and paid within the<span id="page-66881" class="printed_page" data-page="66881"> </span>national OPPS payment rate for the associated procedure or service.</p>
          <p id="p-1413" data-page="66881">Packaging costs into a single aggregate payment for a service, procedure, or episode-of-care is a fundamental principle that distinguishes a prospective payment system from a fee schedule. In general, packaging the costs of items and services into the payment for the primary procedure or service with which they are associated encourages hospital efficiencies and also enables hospitals to manage their resources with maximum flexibility.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Criteria for Packaging Payment for Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals</b></p>
          <br><p><b>a. Background</b></p>
          <p id="p-1414" data-page="66881">As indicated in section V.B.1. of this final rule with comment period, in accordance with section 1833(t)(16)(B) of the Act, the threshold for establishing separate APCs for payment of drugs and biologicals was set to $50 per administration during CYs 2005 and 2006. In CY 2007, we used the four quarter moving average Producer Price Index (PPI) levels for Pharmaceutical Preparations (Prescription) to trend the $50 threshold forward from the third quarter of CY 2005 (when the <a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=108&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=173&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub. L. 108-173</a> mandated threshold became effective) to the third quarter of CY 2007. We then rounded the resulting dollar amount to the nearest $5 increment in order to determine the CY 2007 threshold amount of $55. Using the same methodology as that used in CY 2007 (which is discussed in more detail in the CY 2007 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/71-FR-68085">71 FR 68085</a> through 68086)), we set the packaging threshold for establishing separate APCs for drugs and biologicals at $90 for CY 2014.</p>

We used data from CY 2013 claims processed before January 1, 2014 for this calculation. However, we did not perform this calculation for those drugs and biologicals with multiple HCPCS codes that include different dosages, as described in section V.B.2.c. of the proposed rule, or for the following policy-packaged items that we proposed to continue to package in CY 2015: diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals; contrast agents; anesthesia drugs; drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals that function as supplies when used in a diagnostic test or procedure; and drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure.</p>
          <p id="p-1419" data-page="66881">In order to calculate the per day costs for drugs, biologicals, and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals to determine their proposed packaging status in CY 2015, we used the methodology that was described in detail in the CY 2006 OPPS proposed rule (<a href="/citation/70-FR-42723">70 FR 42723</a> through 42724) and finalized in the CY 2006 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/70-FR-68636">70 FR 68636</a> through 68638). For each drug and biological HCPCS code, we used an estimated payment rate of ASP+6 percent (which is the payment rate we proposed for separately payable drugs and biologicals for CY 2015, as discussed in more detail in section V.B.3.b. of the proposed rule) to calculate the CY 2015 proposed rule per day costs.

Therefore, because of our continued belief that packaging is a fundamental component of a prospective payment system that continues to provide important flexibility and efficiency in the delivery of high quality hospital outpatient services, we are not adopting commenters&apos; recommendations to pay separately for all drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals for CY 2015 or to eliminate the packaging threshold or to freeze the packaging threshold at $90.</p>

We then rounded the resulting updated dollar amount ($93.48) to the nearest $5 increment, which yielded a figure of $95. Therefore, after consideration of the public comments we received, and consistent with our methodology for establishing the packaging threshold using the most recent PPI forecast data, we are adopting a CY 2015 packaging threshold of $95.</p>
          <p id="p-1425" data-page="66882">Our policy during previous cycles of the OPPS has been to use updated ASP and claims data to make final determinations of the packaging status of HCPCS codes for drugs, biologicals, and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for the OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. We note that it is also our policy to make an annual packaging determination for a HCPCS code only when we develop the OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period for the update year. Only HCPCS codes that are identified as separately payable in the final rule with comment period are subject to quarterly updates. For our calculation of per day costs of HCPCS codes for drugs and biologicals in this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we used ASP data from the first quarter of CY 2014, which is the basis for calculating payment rates for drugs and biologicals in the physician&apos;s office setting using the ASP methodology, effective July 1, 2014, along with updated hospital claims data from CY 2013.

          <br><p><b>c. High Cost/Low Cost Threshold for Packaged Skin Substitutes</b></p>

          <p id="p-1432" data-page="66882">In the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74938">78 FR 74938</a>), we unconditionally packaged skin substitute products into their associated surgical procedures as part of a broader policy to package all drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure. The adoption of this policy, to package all drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure, followed these packaging policies: (1) Packaging of medical and surgical supplies into the related procedure under <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-419.2">42 CFR 419.2</a>(b)(4) (<a href="/citation/68-FR-18543">68 FR 18543</a>); (2) packaging of implantable devices (<a href="/citation/68-FR-18444">68 FR 18444</a>); and (3) packaging of implantable biologicals (<a href="/citation/73-FR-68634">73 FR 68634</a>). As noted in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we believe these policies represented an example of a broader category of drugs and biologicals that should be packaged in the OPPS, that is, drugs and biologicals that function as supplies in a surgical procedure (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74930">78 FR 74930</a>). As part of the policy to finalize the packaging of skin substitutes, we also finalized a methodology that divides the skin substitutes into a high cost group and a low cost group, in order to ensure adequate resource homogeneity among APC assignments<span id="page-66883" class="printed_page" data-page="66883"> </span>for the skin substitute application procedures (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74933">78 FR 74933</a>). For the CY 2014 update, assignment to the high cost or low cost skin substitute group depended upon a comparison of the July 2013 ASP+6 percent payment amount for each skin substitute to the weighted average payment per unit for all skin substitutes. The weighted average was calculated using the skin substitute utilization from the CY 2012 claims data and the July 2013 ASP+6 percent payment amounts. The high cost/low cost skin substitute threshold for CY 2014 is $32 per cm<sup>2</sup>. Skin substitutes that had a July 2013 ASP+6 percent amount above $32 per cm<sup>2</sup>were classified in the high cost group, and skin substitutes that had a July 2013 ASP+6 percent amount at or below $32 per cm<sup>2</sup>were classified in the low cost group. Any new skin substitutes without pricing information are assigned to the low cost category until pricing information is available to compare to the $32 per cm<sup>2</sup>threshold for CY 2014. Skin substitutes with pass-through payment status are assigned to the high cost category, with an offset applied as described in section V.A.4.d. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40996">79 FR 40996</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-1433" data-page="66883">As discussed in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40998">79 FR 40998</a> through 40999), after the effective date of the CY 2014 packaging policy, some skin substitute manufacturers brought the following issues to our attention regarding the CY 2014 methodology for determining the high cost/low cost threshold:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1434" data-page="66883"> Using ASP to determine a product&apos;s placement in the high or low cost category may unfairly disadvantage the limited number of skin substitute products that are sold in large sizes (that is, above 150 cm<sup>2</sup>). Large size skin substitute products are primarily used for burns that are treated on an inpatient basis. These manufacturers contend that nonlinear pricing for skin substitute products sold in both large and small sizes results in lower per cm<sup>2</sup>prices for large sizes. Therefore, the use of ASP data to categorize products into high and low cost categories can result in placement of products that have significant inpatient use of the large, lower-priced (per cm<sup>2</sup>) sizes into the low cost category, even though these large size products are not often used in the hospital outpatient department.</li>
          <li id="p-1435" data-page="66883"> Using a weighted average ASP to establish the high/low cost categories, combined with the drug pass-through policy, will lead to unstable high/low cost skin substitute categories in the future. According to one manufacturer, under our CY 2014 policy, manufacturers with products on pass-through payment status have an incentive to set a very high price because hospitals are price-insensitive to products paid with pass-through payments. As these new high priced pass-through skin substitutes capture more market share, the weighted average ASP high cost/low cost threshold could escalate rapidly, resulting in a shift in the assignment of many skin substitutes from the high cost category to the low cost category.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-1436" data-page="66883">As stated in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40998">79 FR 40998</a>), we agree with stakeholder concerns regarding the potential instability of the high/low cost categories associated with the drug pass-through policy, as well as stakeholder concerns about the inclusion of large-sized products that are primarily used for inpatients in the ASP calculation, when ASP is used to establish the high cost/low cost categories. As an alternative to using ASP data, we believe that establishing the high cost/low cost threshold using an alternative methodology (that is, the weighted average mean unit cost (MUC) for all skin substitute products from claims data) may provide more stable high/low cost categories and will resolve the issue associated with large sized products because the MUC will be derived from hospital outpatient claims only. The threshold would be based on costs from hospital outpatient claims data instead of manufacturer reported sales prices that would not include larger sizes primarily used for inpatient burn cases.</p>
          <p id="p-1437" data-page="66883">Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40999">79 FR 40999</a>), we proposed to maintain the high cost/low cost APC structure for skin substitute procedures in CY 2015. However, we proposed to revise the current methodology used to establish the high cost/low cost threshold, and to establish the high cost/low cost threshold based on the weighted average MUC for all skin substitutes using CY 2013 claims (which was proposed to be $27 per cm<sup>2</sup>). Skin substitutes with an MUC above $27 per cm<sup>2</sup>using CY 2013 claims were proposed to be classified in the high cost group and those with an MUC at or below $27 per cm<sup>2</sup>were proposed to be classified in the low cost group. Table 39 of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40999">79 FR 40999</a>) showed the CY 2014 high cost/low cost status for each skin substitute product and the proposed CY 2015 high cost/low cost status based on the weighted average MUC threshold of $27. We proposed to continue the CY 2014 policy that skin substitutes with pass-through payment status would be assigned to the high cost category for CY 2015. Skin substitutes with pricing information but without claims data to calculate an MUC would be assigned to either the high or low cost category based on the product&apos;s ASP+6 percent payment rate. If ASP is not available we would use WAC+6 percent or 95 percent of AWP to assign a product to either the high cost or low cost category. We also proposed that any new skin substitute without pricing information be assigned to the low cost category until pricing information is available to compare to the CY 2015 threshold.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Other commenters requested that CMS retain the ASP-based methodology for calculating the high cost/low cost threshold because, in their opinion, the ASP is a better metric for skin substitute costs than hospital outpatient claims data.</p>
          <p id="p-1441" data-page="66883">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We disagree with the assertion that ASP better represents the hospital costs for skin substitutes than hospital claims data. ASP is a blend of sales prices from a variety of purchasers, including various nonhospital entities. ASP also excludes a significant number of hospital sales, for example sales to 340B hospitals. Hospital claims data are specific to hospitals, and are used in assessing the costs of almost all other items and services in the OPPS, including other similar surgical supplies, such as implantable devices and implantable biologicals, which we package for payment purposes in the OPPS. Furthermore, as stated in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40998">79 FR 40998</a>), we believe that using MUC will better promote stability versus ASP for high and low cost category assignments for skin substitutes, because ASP can be set very high by skin substitute manufacturers and disproportionally impact the threshold calculation.</p>
          <p id="p-1442" data-page="66883">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Two commenters recommended an alternative high cost/low cost threshold calculation methodology. Instead of basing the threshold on the unit cost the commenters urged CMS to calculate the high cost/low cost threshold based on the total skin substitute costs per<span id="page-66884" class="printed_page" data-page="66884"> </span>patient, per day, which is currently the mechanism used to set the general OPPS drug, biological, and radiopharmaceutical packaging threshold, which was proposed as $90 for CY 2015. These commenters believed that calculating the threshold cost per cm<sup>2</sup>does not accurately reflect the true cost of products as they are used clinically, and could result in displacing larger single-size skin substitutes approved through a Premarket Approval (PMA) into the low-cost skin substitute group beginning in CY 2016. They believed that this is partly a consequence of CMS&apos; broad categorization of products as skin substitutes that, according to the commenters, includes 510(k)-cleared wound dressings and human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) (for example, cadaver skin or placental tissue). According to these commenters, manufacturers of products regulated through these processes can market different sizes of their skin substitutes with greater ease than can manufacturers of skin substitutes approved through a PMA, who must reapply for an updated label through the FDA to change or add a different product size. The commenters are concerned that a unit cost threshold may result in large products with lower per cm<sup>2</sup>costs, but with higher total costs per case, being assigned to the low cost category in the future. One of these commenters, although generally supportive of the change from an ASP-based methodology to an MUC-based methodology, also submitted a hypothetical predictive model comparing per unit high cost/low cost calculations with per day threshold calculations for the various skin substitutes and requested that CMS adopt a per day high cost/low cost calculation methodology beginning in CY 2016 to prevent their skin substitutes from moving from the high cost to the low cost group in CY 2016.</p>
          <p id="p-1443" data-page="66884">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As we explained in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, the FDA treatment of the various skin substitutes does not affect how skin substitutes are treated under our policy of packaging drugs and biologicals that function as supplies in a surgical procedure (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74932">78 FR 74932</a> through 74933). The 61 skin substitutes listed in Table 34 below are available in many different sizes. Product sizing, product packaging, quantity per package, and other such individual product attributes are manufacturer business decisions that do not concern the agency. We also believe that the commenters&apos; analogy between the general drug, biological, and radiopharmaceutical packaging threshold and the high cost/low cost skin substitute threshold is imperfect. Per day costs are used for the general drug, biological, and radiopharmaceutical packaging threshold because this threshold applies to the entire spectrum of drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals, which have a wide variety of dosing units and dose descriptors, among others, such that per unit comparisons are not possible and therefore a total per day dollar amount is calculated. On the contrary, skin substitutes divided into the high and low cost categories are all dosed per cm<sup>2</sup>, which is also the standard measurement for sizing wounds. Therefore, notwithstanding the various sizes of the 61 skin substitutes listed in Table 34, meaningful unit cost comparisons can be made for skin substitutes. As discussed earlier, we believe that the MUC methodology will help mitigate or eliminate the effect of high skin substitute ASPs on the high cost/low cost threshold. However, using a per day cost methodology as suggested by the commenters could adversely affect the majority of products that are tailored to the wound size. We will evaluate the per day cost methodology and compare it to the MUC methodology next year once CY 2014 claims data are available.</p>
          <p id="p-1444" data-page="66884">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal to maintain the high cost/low cost APC structure for skin substitute procedures in CY 2015, and our proposal to revise the current methodology used to establish the high/low cost threshold with the alternative MUC methodology. We also are finalizing for CY 2015 the policy that skin substitutes with pass-through payment status would be assigned to the high cost category. Skin substitutes with pricing information but without claims data to calculate an MUC will be assigned to either the high cost or low cost category based on the product&apos;s ASP+6 percent payment rate. If ASP is not available, we will use WAC+6 percent or 95 percent of AWP to assign a product to either the high cost or low cost category. We also are finalizing our proposal that any new skin substitutes without pricing information will be assigned to the low cost category until pricing information is available to compare to the CY 2015 threshold. New skin substitute manufacturers must submit pricing information to CMS no later than the 15th of the third month prior to the effective date of the next OPPS quarterly update. For example, for a new skin substitute with new pricing information to be included in the July 1 OPPS update and designated as included in the high cost group, verifiable pricing information must be provided to CMS no later than April 15. Table 34 below shows the CY 2014 high cost/low cost status for each skin substitute product and the final CY 2015 high cost/low cost status based on the weighted average MUC threshold of $25, which decreased slightly from the proposed $27 threshold due to updated final rule claims data. Skin substitutes with an MUC above $25 are assigned to the high cost group for CY 2015. For 2014 there are 16 high cost skin substitutes and 27 low cost skin substitutes. For CY 2015, there are 62 skin substitute codes, which represent the following products: 30 high cost skin substitutes; 24 low cost skin substitutes; 7 powdered, liquid, or micronized skin substitutes; and 1 miscellaneous skin substitute code.</p>

          <p id="p-1445" data-page="66885">At the beginning of the OPPS, skin substitutes were originally evaluated for pass-through status using the medical device pass-through process (<a href="/citation/65-FR-67839">65 FR 67839</a>). Since mid-2001, skin substitutes have been evaluated for pass-through payment status through the drug, biological, and radiopharmaceutical pass-through payment process. In 2001, there were two distinct HCPCS codes describing skin substitutes. For the CY 2015 update, there are 61 distinct HCPCS codes describing skin substitutes (not including the not otherwise classified HCPCS code, Q4100), and of these 61 products, 18<span id="page-66886" class="printed_page" data-page="66886"> </span>products that are listed in Table 35 below have had, currently have, or will have pass-through payment status.</p>

          <p id="p-1446" data-page="66886">As discussed earlier, and as we stated in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40999">79 FR 40999</a> through 41001) and in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74938">78 FR 74938</a>), we packaged all skin substitutes not on pass-through payment status under the policy that packages all drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74938">78 FR 74938</a>), because we consider skin substitutes to be a type of surgical supply in the HOPD. The adoption of the policy to package all drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure, followed the packaging policies for implantable biologicals, implantable devices, and more broadly, the policy to package medical and surgical supplies into the related procedure under <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-419.2">42 CFR 419.2</a>(b)(4). Further, as noted in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we believe these policies represented an example of a broader category of drugs and biologicals that should be packaged in the OPPS, that is, drugs and biologicals that function as supplies in a surgical procedure (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74930">78 FR 74930</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-1447" data-page="66886">Separately, in the CY 2010 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we finalized a policy to evaluate implantable biologicals that are surgically inserted or implanted (through a surgical incision or a natural orifice) for pass-through payment through the medical device pass-through evaluation process, because implantable biologicals function as implantable devices (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60473">74 FR 60473</a>), which have historically been considered supplies in the OPPS (<a href="/citation/65-FR-18443">65 FR 18443</a>), and have been evaluated for pass-through payment through the medical device pass-through evaluation process since CY 2010. As noted earlier, the finalized packaging policy in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period to package all drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure included skin substitutes as a type of surgical supply, and, notably, the similarities between implantable biologicals and skin substitutes were a key factor in packaging (like we did beginning in 2009 with implantable biologicals) skin substitutes into the associated surgical procedure (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74932">78 FR 74932</a>). We also note that many skin substitutes are FDA-approved or cleared as devices, even though skin substitutes have traditionally been treated as biologicals under the OPPS. The similarities between these classes of products (implantable devices, implantable biologicals, and skin substitutes) informed our proposal to similarly treat applications for pass-through payment for skin substitutes using the OPPS device pass-through process, described below.</p>

          <p id="p-1448" data-page="66886">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41000">79 FR 41000</a>), we proposed that applications for pass-through payment for skin substitutes be evaluated using the medical device pass-through process and payment methodology. As a result of this proposal, we proposed that the last skin substitute pass-through applications evaluated using the drug and biological pass-through payment evaluation process would be those with an application deadline of the first business date in September 2014, and an effective date of January 1, 2015. In light of this proposal, we would change the December 1, 2014 pass-through payment application deadline (for an effective date of April 1, 2015) for both drugs and biologicals and devices to January 15, 2015, in order to provide sufficient time for applicants to adjust to the new policies and procedures in effect as of January 1, 2015. Any applications submitted after the first business date in September 2014, through January 15, 2015, would be evaluated for the April 1, 2015 cycle. We believe that requiring skin substitutes seeking pass-through payment to use the OPPS device pass-through evaluation process is more appropriate because, although skin substitutes have characteristics of both surgical supplies and biologicals, we believe skin substitutes are best characterized as surgical supplies or devices because of their required surgical application and because they share significant clinical similarity with other surgical devices and supplies, including implantable biologicals. Therefore, we stated in the proposed rule that if this proposal is finalized, beginning with applications seeking pass-through payment effective April 1, 2014, new skin substitutes would no longer be eligible to submit biological pass-through applications; rather, such applications for pass-through payment would be evaluated using the medical device pass-through payment evaluation process, for which payment is based on charges reduced to cost from claims. We<span id="page-66887" class="printed_page" data-page="66887"> </span>refer readers to the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/</a></i> to view the device pass-through payment application requirements and review criteria that would apply to the evaluation of all skin substitute product applications for pass-through payment status beginning on or after January 1, 2015. Those skin substitutes that are approved for pass-through payment status as biologicals effective on or before January 1, 2015, would continue to be paid as pass-through biologicals for the duration of their period of pass-through payment.</p>
          <p id="p-1449" data-page="66887">We also proposed to revise our regulations at &#xA7;&#xA7; 419.64 and 419.66 to reflect this proposed new policy. Specifically, we proposed to revise &#xA7; 419.64 by deleting the existing paragraph (a)(4)(iv) text because it is currently outdated and adding new text at paragraph (a)(4)(iv) to exclude skin substitutes from consideration for drug and biological pass-through payment. We proposed to modify the regulation at &#xA7; 419.66(b)(3) to add that a pass-through device may be applied in or on a wound or other skin lesion, and we proposed to simplify the language that &#x201C;whether or not it remains with the patient when the patient is released from the hospital&#x201D; to read &#x201C;either permanently or temporarily.&#x201D; We also proposed to delete the current example in &#xA7; 419.66(b)(4)(iii) of the regulations regarding the exclusion of materials, for example, biological or synthetic materials, that may be used to replace human skin from device pass-through payment eligibility. We invited public comment on these proposals.</p>
          <p id="p-1450" data-page="66887">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters supported CMS&apos; proposal to evaluate skin substitute pass-through applications through the medical device pass-through process and pay for pass-through skin substitutes according to the medical device pass-through payment methodology beginning January 1, 2015. The commenters believed that this policy change will limit instability in the high cost/low cost groups from pass-through skin substitutes with very high ASPs. The commenter stated that instability could occur because manufacturers set ASP and hospitals are relatively insensitive to price for separately paid pass-through skin substitutes. Therefore, the commenter added, a new high priced pass-through skin substitute could gain significant sales and move the high cost/low cost threshold significantly higher from year to year.</p>
          <p id="p-1451" data-page="66887">

          <p id="p-1452" data-page="66887">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters opposed CMS&apos; proposal to evaluate skin substitute pass-through applications through the medical device pass-through process. Some of these commenters argued that CMS lacks the authority to change the process for evaluating skin substitute pass-through applications. The commenters also believed that biologicals approved by the FDA under section 351 of the PHSA (those approved by the FDA under biologics license applications (BLAs)) cannot be treated as devices for pass-through payment evaluation purposes according to the Social Security Act and Congressional intent. The commenters also claimed that changing the pass-through payment process for skin substitutes will stifle innovation of new wound care products.</p>
          <p id="p-1453" data-page="66887">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We disagree with the commenters&apos; assertion that the agency lacks the authority to change the process for evaluating skin substitutes for pass-through and that biologicals approved by the FDA under section 351 of the PHSA (BLA process) cannot be treated as devices for pass-through payment evaluation purposes according to the Social Security Act and Congressional intent. As we stated in the 2010 OPPS final rule in response to a similar comment on the proposal to change the pass-through evaluation process for implantable biologicals: &#x201C;We do not agree with the commenters who asserted that Congress intended biologicals approved under BLAs to be paid under the specific OPPS statutory provisions that apply to SCODs, including the pass-through provisions&#x201D; (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60476">74 FR 60476</a>). Similarly, Congress did not specify that we must pay for skin substitutes as separately payable biologicals rather than devices or supplies, if they also meet our criteria for payment as a device. We believe that skin substitutes can satisfy the definitions applied under the OPPS of a device or supply and a biological and that, for OPPS payment purposes, it is appropriate for us to consider skin substitutes as devices or supplies under both pass-through and nonpass-through payment policies, and not as separately payable biologicals. For example, beginning in CY 2014, we package the costs of skin substitutes into the costs of the surgical procedures in which they are used, as we do for implantable biologicals and other implantable devices. Therefore, we do not believe that we must pay for skin substitutes under our OPPS payment methodologies for separately payable biologicals, rather than our device payment methodologies.</p>
          <p id="p-1454" data-page="66887">In addition, for the skin substitute packaging policy, in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74933">78 FR 74933</a>), we stated the following: &#x201C;We do not believe that the FDA approval process should exempt products from this packaging proposal or factor into the level of Medicare payment.&#x201D; Similarly, regarding our proposal to change the pass-through payment evaluation process and payment methodology for skin substitutes from the drug and biological process to the device process, we also believe that any particular FDA approval process should not exempt such products that appropriately fall under the category of skin substitutes under the OPPS from the application of this pass-through payment proposal or direct which pass-through payment evaluation process must be used.</p>
          <p id="p-1455" data-page="66887">Notably, none of the current 61 skin substitute products described by distinct HCPCS codes and listed in Table 35 above have been approved by FDA under section 351 of the PHSA. This fact is somewhat counterintuitive, as biologics or biologicals or biological products are most commonly understood to be products approved by the FDA under section 351 of the PHSA. Current skin substitute products&apos; FDA classifications include a variety of Class III medical devices, Class II medical devices, and HCT/Ps under section 361 of the PHSA, which are tissue bank materials not subject to FDA approval requirements. We also note that whether a future wound healing product is described by the OPPS packaged category of products described in <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-419.2">42 CFR 419.2</a>(b)(16) as &#x201C;skin substitutes and similar products that aid wound healing&#x201D; will depend upon the particular characteristics of the future product. We do not intend for the category of products described as &#x201C;skin substitutes and similar products that aid wound healing&#x201D; to necessarily include all products with a wound healing indication. However, if a new wound healing product, regardless of FDA approval or clearance type, fits with the &#x201C;skin substitutes and similar products that aid wound healing&#x201D; category of products, all of the applicable OPPS policies that apply to &#x201C;skin substitutes and similar products that aid wound healing&#x201D; would also apply to the new wound healing product.</p>

          <p id="p-1456" data-page="66887">Finally, we do not believe that this policy will stifle innovation of new skin substitutes, as new skin substitutes that can demonstrate a substantial clinical improvement over current wound treatments could receive pass-through<span id="page-66888" class="printed_page" data-page="66888"> </span>status as a device. In addition, there are currently 61 distinct HCPCS codes for various skin substitutes. Of these 61 products, only 18 (30 percent) have had, currently have, or will have pass-through payment status granted through the drug and biological pass-through payment process. Therefore, pass-through payment does not appear to be necessary for the commercialization of these products, which have (in terms of distinct HCPCS codes describing them) expanded significantly from 2 skin substitutes in CY 2001 to 61 skin substitutes in CY 2015. Furthermore, we have not restricted access to the high cost skin substitute group, and we have only required manufacturers of new skin substitutes to submit pricing information for assignment to the high cost group of skin substitutes. For these reasons, we do not believe that any CMS OPPS payment policies will stifle innovation or impede the development of new skin substitutes.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter was concerned that the substantial clinical improvement criterion for medical device pass-through places an unduly high burden on new skin substitute products. The commenter believed that this requirement is &#x201C;incompatible with skin substitute products, which are not required to submit efficacy data to the Food and Drug Administration.&#x201D; This commenter also disagreed with CMS&apos; proposal to not accept any skin substitute applications though the drug and biological pass-through payment process after September 1, 2014, and to move the final pass-through payment deadline for drug and biologicals and devices from December 1, 2014, to January 15, 2015. The commenter requested that additional guidance on substantial clinical improvement be provided specifically for application to skin substitute products, beyond that described in the November 2, 2001, interim final rule with comment period entitled &#x201C;Medicare Program&#x2014;Prospective Payment System for Hospital Outpatient Services: Criteria for Establishing Additional Pass-Through Categories for Medical Devices&#x201D; (<a href="/citation/66-FR-55850">66 FR 55850</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-1458" data-page="66888">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The comment that FDA does not require submission of efficacy data for skin substitute products is overly simplified. The different skin substitute products that have been identified in Table 35 above are subject to different FDA regulatory requirements (that is, based on review by CBER versus CDRH, regulatory classification and claims).</p>
          <p id="p-1459" data-page="66888">FDA/CDRH draws a distinction between wound dressing devices intended only to serve as a wound covering versus products intended to promote wound healing. Those devices that are intended to promote wound healing are subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) and require clinical data to support safety and effectiveness of the device. Those devices that are intended to serve as a wound covering are subject to Premarket Notification (510(k)) and require demonstration of substantial equivalence (that is, the device demonstrates that it is as safe and effective as a legally marketed predicate device). Generally, substantial equivalence in safety and effectiveness is demonstrated through comparative bench and animal studies and leveraged with historical clinical effectiveness data for similar devices. The weakness of the evidence for many skin substitute products has been documented in two recent technology assessments by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. However, different pre-market data requirements for skin substitute products regulated by FDA should not excuse these products from the substantial clinical improvement pass-through criterion for device pass-through payment. Pass-through payment status is not intended to be granted to every new product, but only to those that satisfy the pass-through payment requirements. As stated in the CY 2001 OPPS interim final rule: &#x201C;We believe it is important for hospitals to receive pass-through payments for devices that offer substantial clinical improvement in the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries to facilitate access by beneficiaries to the advantages of the new technology. Conversely, the need for additional payments for devices that offer little or no clinical improvement over a previously existing device is less apparent&#x201D; (<a href="/citation/66-FR-55852">66 FR 55852</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-1460" data-page="66888">Regarding the requirements for satisfying the substantial clinical improvement criterion, we believe that the list on page 55852 of the CY 2001 OPPS interim final rule suffices. For example, among the items listed is: &#x201C;More rapid beneficial resolution of the disease process treated because of the use of the device.&#x201D; If a new skin substitute demonstrated improved wound healing compared to existing wound treatments, it could potentially qualify for pass-through as a medical device, assuming that the skin substitute is not described by an expired pass-through payment device category.</p>
          <p id="p-1461" data-page="66888">Finally, we believe that sufficient notice was provided of this policy change in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, and that accepting drug and biological applications through the first business date of September 2014 deadline for a January 1, 2015 pass-through payment effective date is a fair application of a policy that takes effect on January 1, 2015. The regular December 1, 2014 application deadline, which is being extended to January 15, 2015 for this cycle, was for pass-through payment applications with an earliest effective date of April 1, 2015, which is well past the effective date of this new policy.</p>
          <p id="p-1462" data-page="66888">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal for applications seeking pass-through payment for skin substitute and similar wound healing products effective beginning April 1, 2015, to apply using the medical device pass-through evaluation process.</p>
          <br><p><b>e. Packaging Determination for HCPCS Codes That Describe the Same Drug or Biological but Different Dosages</b></p>
          <p id="p-1463" data-page="66888">In the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/72-FR-66776">72 FR 66776</a>), we began recognizing, for OPPS payment purposes, multiple HCPCS codes reporting different dosages for the same covered Part B drugs or biologicals in order to reduce hospitals&apos; administrative burden by permitting them to report all HCPCS codes for drugs and biologicals. In general, prior to CY 2008, the OPPS recognized for payment only the HCPCS code that described the lowest dosage of a drug or biological. During CYs 2008 and 2009, we applied a policy that assigned the status indicator of the previously recognized HCPCS code to the associated newly recognized code(s), reflecting the packaged or separately payable status of the new code(s).</p>

          <p id="p-1464" data-page="66888">In the CY 2010 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60490">74 FR 60490</a> through 60491), we finalized a policy to make a single packaging determination for a drug, rather than an individual HCPCS code, when a drug has multiple HCPCS codes describing different dosages because we believed that adopting the standard HCPCS code-specific packaging determinations for these codes could lead to inappropriate payment incentives for hospitals to report certain HCPCS codes instead of others. We continue to believe that making packaging determinations on a drug-specific basis eliminates payment incentives for hospitals to report certain HCPCS codes for drugs and allows hospitals flexibility in choosing to report all HCPCS codes for different dosages of the same drug or only the lowest dosage HCPCS code. Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41001">79 FR 41001</a>), we proposed to continue our policy to make packaging determinations on a drug-specific basis, rather than a HCPCS code-specific basis, for those HCPCS codes that describe the<span id="page-66889" class="printed_page" data-page="66889"> </span>same drug or biological but different dosages in CY 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-1465" data-page="66889">For CY 2015, in order to propose a packaging determination that is consistent across all HCPCS codes that describe different dosages of the same drug or biological, we aggregated both our CY 2013 claims data and our pricing information at ASP+6 percent across all of the HCPCS codes that describe each distinct drug or biological in order to determine the mean units per day of the drug or biological in terms of the HCPCS code with the lowest dosage descriptor. The following drugs did not have pricing information available for the ASP methodology for this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period and, as is our current policy for determining the packaging status of other drugs, we used the mean unit cost available from the fourth quarter CY 2013 claims data to make the packaging determinations for these drugs: HCPCS code J3471 (Injection, hyaluronidase, ovine, preservative free, per 1 usp unit (up to 999 usp units)) and HCPCS code J3472 (Injection, hyaluronidase, ovine, preservative free, per 1000 usp units).</p>
          <p id="p-1466" data-page="66889">For all other drugs and biologicals that have HCPCS codes describing different doses, we then multiplied the weighted average ASP+6 percent per unit payment amount across all dosage levels of a specific drug or biological by the estimated units per day for all HCPCS codes that describe each drug or biological from our claims data to determine the estimated per day cost of each drug or biological at less than or equal to $95 (so that all HCPCS codes for the same drug or biological would be packaged) or greater than $95 (so that all HCPCS codes for the same drug or biological would be separately payable).</p>
          <p id="p-1467" data-page="66889">The proposed packaging status of each drug and biological HCPCS code to which this methodology would apply was displayed in Table 41 of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41001">79 FR 41001</a> through 41002).</p>
          <p id="p-1468" data-page="66889">We did not receive any public comments on this proposal. Therefore, we are finalizing our CY 2015 proposal, without modification, to continue to make packaging determinations on a drug-specific basis, rather than a HCPCS code-specific basis, for those HCPCS codes that describe the same drug or biological but different dosages. Table 36 below displays the packaging status of each drug and biological HCPCS code to which the methodology applies for CY 2015.</p>

          <p id="p-1469" data-page="66890">Section 1833(t)(14) of the Act defines certain separately payable radiopharmaceuticals, drugs, and biologicals and mandates specific payments for these items. Under section 1833(t)(14)(B)(i) of the Act, a &#x201C;specified covered outpatient drug&#x201D; (known as a SCOD) is defined as a covered outpatient drug, as defined in section 1927(k)(2) of the Act, for which a separate APC has been established and that either is a radiopharmaceutical agent or is a drug or biological for which payment was made on a pass-through basis on or before December 31, 2002.</p>

</ul>
          <p id="p-1474" data-page="66890">Section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii) of the Act requires that payment for SCODs in CY 2006 and subsequent years be equal to the average acquisition cost for the drug for that year as determined by the Secretary, subject to any adjustment for overhead costs and taking into account the hospital acquisition cost survey data collected by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in CYs 2004 and 2005, and later periodic surveys conducted by the Secretary as set forth in the statute. If hospital acquisition cost data are not available, the law requires that payment be equal to payment rates established under the methodology described in section 1842(o), section 1847A, or section 1847B of the Act, as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary as necessary. Most physician Part B drugs are paid at ASP+6 percent pursuant to section 1842(o) and section 1847A of the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-1475" data-page="66890">Section 1833(t)(14)(E)(ii) of the Act provides for an adjustment in OPPS payment rates for SCODs to take into account overhead and related expenses, such as pharmacy services and handling costs. Section 1833(t)(14)(E)(i) of the Act required MedPAC to study pharmacy overhead and related expenses and to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding whether, and if so how, a payment adjustment should be made to compensate hospitals for overhead and related expenses. Section 1833(t)(14)(E)(ii) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to adjust the weights for ambulatory procedure classifications for SCODs to take into account the findings of the MedPAC study.</p>
          <p id="p-1476" data-page="66890">It has been our longstanding policy to apply the same treatment to all separately payable drugs and biologicals, which include SCODs, and drugs and biologicals that are not SCODs. Therefore, we apply the payment methodology in section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii) of the Act to SCODs, as required by statute, but we also apply it to separately payable drugs and biologicals that are not SCODs, which is a policy determination rather than a statutory requirement. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41002">79 FR 41002</a>), we proposed to apply section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II) of the Act to all separately payable drugs and biologicals, including SCODs. Although we do not distinguish SCODs in this discussion, we note that we are required to apply section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II) of the Act to SCODs, but we also are applying this provision to other separately payable drugs and biologicals, consistent with our history of using the same payment methodology for all separately payable drugs and biologicals.</p>
          <p id="p-1477" data-page="66890">Since CY 2006, we have attempted to establish a drug payment methodology that reflects hospitals&apos; acquisition costs for drugs and biologicals while taking into account relevant pharmacy overhead and related handling expenses. We have attempted to collect more data on hospital overhead charges for drugs and biologicals by making several proposals that would require hospitals to change the way they report the cost and charges for drugs. None of these proposals were adopted due to significant stakeholder concern, including that hospitals stated that it would be administratively burdensome to report hospital overhead charges. We established a payment policy for separately payable drugs and biologicals, authorized by section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii)(I) of the Act, based on an ASP+X amount that is calculated by comparing the estimated aggregate cost of separately payable drugs and biologicals in our claims data to the estimated aggregate ASP dollars for separately payable drugs and biologicals, using the ASP as a proxy for average acquisition cost (<a href="/citation/70-FR-68642">70 FR 68642</a> through 68643). We referred to this methodology as our standard drug payment methodology. Taking into consideration comments made by the pharmacy stakeholders and acknowledging the limitations of the reported data due to charge compression and hospitals&apos; reporting practices, we added an &#x201C;overhead adjustment&#x201D; in CY 2010 (an internal adjustment of the data) by redistributing cost from coded and uncoded packaged drugs and biologicals to separately payable drugs in order to provide more appropriate payments for drugs and biologicals in the HOPD. We continued this methodology, and we further refined it in CY 2012 by finalizing a policy to update the redistribution amount for inflation and to keep the redistribution ratio constant between the proposed rule and the final rule. For a detailed discussion of our OPPS drug payment policies from CY 2006 to CY 2012, we refer readers to the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68383">77 FR 68383</a> through 68385).</p>

          <p id="p-1478" data-page="66890">Because of continuing uncertainty about the full cost of pharmacy overhead and acquisition cost, based in large part on the limitations of the submitted hospital charge and claims data for drugs, in the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68386">77 FR 68386</a>), we indicated our concern that the continued use of the standard drug payment methodology (including the overhead adjustment) still may not appropriately account for average acquisition and pharmacy overhead cost and, therefore, may result in payment rates that are not as predictable, accurate, or appropriate as they could be. Section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II) of the Act requires an alternative methodology for determining payment rates for SCODS wherein, if hospital acquisition cost data are not available, payment shall be equal (subject to any adjustment for overhead costs) to payment rates established under the methodology described in section 1842(o), 1847A, or 1847B of the Act.

Pursuant to sections 1842(o) and 1847A of the Act, Part B drugs are paid at ASP+6 percent when furnished in physicians&apos; offices. We indicated that we believe that establishing the payment rates based on<span id="page-66891" class="printed_page" data-page="66891"> </span>the statutory default of ASP+6 percent is appropriate as it yields increased predictability in payment for separately payable drugs and biologicals under the OPPS and, therefore, we finalized our proposal for CY 2013 to pay for separately payable drugs and biologicals at ASP+6 percent based on section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II) of the Act (the statutory default). We also finalized our proposal that the ASP+6 percent payment amount for separately payable drugs and biologicals requires no further adjustment and represents the combined acquisition and pharmacy overhead payment for drugs and biologicals, that payments for separately payable drugs and biologicals are included in the budget neutrality adjustments under the requirements in section 1833(t)(9)(B) of the Act, and that the budget neutral weight scaler is not applied in determining payments for these separately paid drugs and biologicals for CY 2013 (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68389">77 FR 68389</a>).</p>

In addition, we are finalizing our proposal which states that payment for separately payable drugs and biologicals be included in the budget neutrality adjustments, under the requirements of section 1833(t)(9)(B) of the Act, and that the budget neutral weight scaler is not applied in determining payment of these separately paid drugs and biologicals. We note that separately payable drug and biological payment rates listed in Addenda A and B to this final rule with comment period (available via the Internet on the CMS Web site), which illustrate the final CY 2015 payment of ASP+6 percent for separately payable nonpass-through drugs and biologicals and ASP+6 percent for pass-through drugs and biologicals, reflect either ASP information that is the basis for calculating payment rates for drugs and biologicals in the physician&apos;s office setting effective October 1, 2014, or WAC, AWP, or mean unit cost from CY 2013 claims data and updated cost report information available for this final rule with comment period. In general, these published payment rates are not reflective of actual January 2015 payment rates. This is because payment rates for drugs and biologicals with ASP information for January 2015 will be determined through the standard quarterly process where ASP data submitted by manufacturers for the third quarter of 2014 (July 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014) are used to set the payment rates that are released for the quarter beginning in January 2015 near the end of December 2014. In addition, payment rates for drugs and biologicals in Addenda A and B to this final rule with comment period for which there was no ASP information available for October 2014 are based on mean unit cost in the available CY 2013 claims data. If ASP information becomes available for payment for the quarter beginning in January 2015, we will price payment for these drugs and biologicals based on their newly available ASP information. Finally, there may be drugs and biologicals that have ASP information available for this final rule with comment period (reflecting October 2014 ASP data) that do not have ASP information available for the quarter beginning in January 2015. These drugs and biologicals will then be paid based on mean unit cost data derived from CY 2013 hospital claims. Therefore, the payment rates listed in Addenda A and B to this final rule with comment period are not for January 2015 payment purposes and are only illustrative of the CY 2015 OPPS payment methodology using the most recently available information at the time of issuance of this final rule with comment period.</p>

          <p id="p-1483" data-page="66891">Beginning in CY 2010 and continuing for CY 2014, we established a policy to pay for separately paid therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals under the ASP methodology adopted for separately payable drugs and biologicals. If ASP information is unavailable for a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical, we base therapeutic radiopharmaceutical payment on mean unit cost data derived from hospital claims. We believe that the rationale outlined in the CY 2010 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60524">74 FR 60524</a> through 60525) for applying the principles of separately payable drug pricing to therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals continues to be appropriate for nonpass-through separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals in CY 2015. Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41003">79 FR 41003</a>), we proposed for CY 2015 to pay all nonpass-through, separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals at ASP+6 percent, based on the statutory default described in section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii)(II) of the Act. For a full discussion of ASP-based payment for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, we refer readers to the CY 2010 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60520">74 FR 60520</a> through 60521). We also proposed to rely on CY 2013 mean unit cost data derived from hospital claims data for payment rates for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for which ASP data are unavailable and to update the payment rates for separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals according to our usual process for updating the payment rates for separately payable drugs and biologicals, on a quarterly basis if updated ASP information is available. For a complete history of the OPPS payment policy for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, we refer readers<span id="page-66892" class="printed_page" data-page="66892"> </span>to the CY 2005 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/69-FR-65811">69 FR 65811</a>), the CY 2006 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/70-FR-68655">70 FR 68655</a>), and the CY 2010 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60524">74 FR 60524</a>).</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate the commenters&apos; support. We continue to believe that providing payment for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals based on ASP or mean unit cost if ASP information is not available would provide appropriate payment for these products. When ASP data are not available, we believe that paying for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals using mean unit cost will appropriately pay for the average hospital acquisition and associated handling costs of nonpass-through separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. As we stated in the CY 2010 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/74-FR-60523">74 FR 60523</a>), although using mean unit cost for payment for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals when ASP data are not available is not the usual OPPS process (the usual process relies on alternative data sources such as WAC or AWP when ASP information is temporarily unavailable, prior to defaulting to the mean unit cost from hospital claims data), we continue to believe that WAC or AWP is not an appropriate proxy to provide OPPS payment for average therapeutic radiopharmaceutical acquisition cost and associated handling costs when manufacturers are not required to submit ASP data. Payment based on WAC or AWP under the established OPPS methodology for payment of separately payable drugs and biologicals is usually temporary for a calendar quarter until a manufacturer is able to submit the required ASP data in accordance with the quarterly ASP submission timeframes for reporting under section 1847A of the Act. Because ASP reporting for OPPS payment of separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is not required, a manufacturer&apos;s choice to not submit ASP could result in payment for a separately payable therapeutic radiopharmaceutical based on WAC or AWP for a full year, a result that we believe would be inappropriate.</p>

          <p id="p-1488" data-page="66892">Radioisotopes are widely used in modern medical imaging, particularly for cardiac imaging and predominantly for the Medicare population. Technetium-99 (Tc-99m), the radioisotope used in the majority of such diagnostic imaging services, is currently produced in legacy reactors outside of the United States using highly enriched uranium (HEU).</p>
          <p id="p-1489" data-page="66892">The United States would like to eliminate domestic reliance on these reactors, and is promoting the conversion of all medical radioisotope production to non-HEU sources. Alternative methods for producing Tc-99m without HEU are technologically and economically viable, and conversion to such production has begun and is expected to be completed within a 3-year time period. We expect this change in the supply source for the radioisotope used for modern medical imaging will introduce new costs into the payment system that are not accounted for in the historical claims data.</p>
          <p id="p-1490" data-page="66892">Therefore, for CY 2013, we finalized a policy to provide an additional payment of $10 for the marginal cost for radioisotopes produced by non-HEU sources (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68323">77 FR 68323</a>). Under this policy, hospitals report HCPCS code Q9969 (Tc-99m from non-highly enriched uranium source, full cost recovery add-on per study dose) once per dose along with any diagnostic scan or scans furnished using Tc-99m as long as the Tc-99m doses used can be certified by the hospital to be at least 95 percent derived from non-HEU sources. The time period for this additional payment was not to exceed 5 years from January 1, 2013 (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68321">77 FR 68321</a>).</p>

We further stated that we would reassess, and propose if necessary, on an annual basis whether such an adjustment continued to be necessary and whether any changes to the adjustment were warranted. We have reassessed this payment for CY 2015 and have not identified any new information that would cause us to modify payment at this time. We do not agree with the commenter&apos;s suggestion to eliminate the beneficiary&apos;s copayment because section 1833(t)(8) of the Act and &#xA7;&#xA7; 419.41 through 419.45 of the regulations require a beneficiary copayment. We are continuing the policy of providing an additional $10 payment for radioisotopes produced by non-HEU sources for CY 2015.

Because there was no statutory provision that dictated payment for such drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals in CY 2005, and because we had no hospital claims data to use in establishing a payment rate for them, we investigated several payment options for CY 2005 and discussed them in detail in the CY 2005 OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/69-FR-65797">69 FR 65797</a> through 65799).</p>
          <p id="p-1499" data-page="66893">For CYs 2005 to 2007, we implemented a policy to provide separate payment for new drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals with HCPCS codes (specifically those new drug, biological, and radiopharmaceutical HCPCS codes in each of those calendar years that did not crosswalk to predecessor HCPCS codes) but which did not have pass-through status, at a rate that was equivalent to the payment they received in the physician&apos;s office setting, established in accordance with the ASP methodology for drugs and biologicals, and based on charges adjusted to cost for radiopharmaceuticals. Beginning in CY 2008 and continuing through CY 2014, we implemented a policy to provide payment for new drugs and biologicals with HCPCS codes (except those that are policy-packaged), but which did not have pass-through status and were without OPPS hospital claims data, at an amount consistent with the final OPPS payment methodology for other separately payable nonpass-through drugs and biologicals for the given year.</p>

However, we note that if the WAC is also unavailable, we would make payment at 95 percent of the product&apos;s most recent AWP.

The payment rates for new therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals also would be changed accordingly based on later quarter ASP submissions. We note that the new CY 2015 HCPCS codes for drugs, biologicals, and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals were not available at the time of development of the proposed rule.

In order to determine the packaging status of these products for CY 2015, we proposed to continue our policy to calculate an estimate of the per day cost of each of these items by multiplying the payment rate of each product based on ASP+6 percent, similar to other nonpass-through drugs and biologicals paid separately under the OPPS, by an estimated average number of units of each product that would typically be furnished to a patient during one day in the hospital outpatient setting. This rationale was first adopted in the CY 2006 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/70-FR-68666">70 FR 68666</a> through 68667).</p>

The proposed estimated units per day and status indicators for these items were displayed in Table 42 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41005">79 FR 41005</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-1507" data-page="66894">Finally, there were 35 drugs and biologicals, shown in Table 43 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41005">79 FR 41005</a> through 41006), that were payable in CY 2013 but for which we lacked CY 2013 claims data and any other pricing information for the ASP methodology for the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. For CY 2010, we finalized a policy to assign status indicator &#x201C;E&#x201D; (Not paid by Medicare when submitted on outpatient claims [any outpatient bill type]) whenever we lacked claims data and pricing information and were unable to determine the per day cost of a drug or biological. In addition, we noted that we would provide separate payment for these drugs and biologicals if pricing information reflecting recent sales became available mid-year for the ASP methodology.</p>
          <p id="p-1508" data-page="66894">For CY 2015, as we finalized in CY 2014 (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75031">78 FR 75031</a>), we proposed to continue to assign status indicator &#x201C;E&#x201D; to drugs and biologicals that lack CY 2013 claims data and pricing information for the ASP methodology. All drugs and biologicals without CY 2013 hospital claims data or data based on the ASP methodology that were assigned status indicator &#x201C;E&#x201D; on this basis at the time of the proposed rule for CY 2015 were displayed in Table 43 of the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41005">79 FR 41005</a> through 41006). We also proposed to continue our policy to assign the products status indicator &#x201C;K&#x201D; and pay for them separately for the remainder of CY 2015 if pricing information becomes available.</p>
          <p id="p-1509" data-page="66894">We did not receive any specific public comments regarding our proposed payment for nonpass-through drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals with HCPCS codes, but without OPPS hospital claims data. Many commenters supported our proposal to pay for separately payable drugs at ASP+6 percent under the statutory default. However, these comments were not specific to new drugs and biologicals with HCPCS codes but without OPPS claims data.</p>
          <p id="p-1510" data-page="66894">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our CY 2015 proposal without modification, including our proposal to assign drug or biological products status indicator &#x201C;K&#x201D; and pay for them separately for the remainder of CY 2015 if pricing information becomes available. The final estimated units per day and status indicators for drugs and biologicals without CY 2013 claims data are displayed in Table 37 below.</p>

All drugs and biologicals without CY 2013 hospital claims data and without pricing information for the ASP methodology that are assigned status indicator &#x201C;E&#x201D; on this basis at the time of this final rule with comment period for CY 2015 are displayed in Table 38 below.<span id="page-66895" class="printed_page" data-page="66895"> </span>

<h3>X. Nonrecurring Policy Changes: Collecting Data on Services Furnished in Off-Campus Provider-Based Departments of Hospitals <a name="#table_of_contents" class="back_to_top">Back to Top</a>
</h3>


          <p id="p-1648" data-page="66910">As we discussed in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC proposed rule and final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-43626">78 FR 43626</a> and <a href="/citation/78-FR-75061">78 FR 75061</a>) and in the CY 2014 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) proposed rule and final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-43301">78 FR 43301</a> and <a href="/citation/78-FR-74427">78 FR 74427</a>), in recent years, the research literature and popular press have documented the increased trend toward hospital acquisition of physician practices, integration of those practices as a department of the hospital, and the resultant increase in the delivery of physicians&apos; services in a hospital setting. When a Medicare beneficiary receives outpatient services in a hospital, the total payment amount for outpatient services made by Medicare is generally higher than the total payment amount made by Medicare when a physician furnishes those same services in a freestanding clinic or in a physicians&apos; office.</p>

          <p id="p-1649" data-page="66910">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41013">79 FR 41013</a>), we stated that we continue to seek a better understanding of how the growing trend toward hospital acquisition of physicians&apos; offices and subsequent treatment of those locations as off-campus provider-based departments (PBDs) of hospitals affects payments under the MPFS and the OPPS, as well as beneficiary cost-sharing obligations. We also noted that MedPAC continues to question the appropriateness of increased Medicare payment and beneficiary cost-sharing when physicians&apos; offices become hospital outpatient departments and to recommend that Medicare pay selected hospital outpatient services at MPFS rates (MedPAC March 2012 and June 2013 <i class="E-03">Report to Congress</i>). In order to understand how this trend is affecting Medicare, we need information on the extent to which this shift is occurring. To that end, during the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC rulemaking cycle, we sought public comment regarding the best method for collecting information and data that would allow us to analyze the frequency, type, and payment for physicians&apos; and outpatient hospital services furnished in off-campus PBDs of hospitals (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75061">78 FR 75061</a> through 75062 and <a href="/citation/78-FR-74427">78 FR 74427</a> through 74428). In response to our solicitation, we received many detailed public comments. However, the commenters did not present a consensus opinion regarding whether this data collection was advisable or which data collection method would be preferable. Based on our analysis of the public comments we received, we proposed for the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule that the most efficient and equitable means of gathering this important information across two different payment systems would be to create a HCPCS modifier to be reported with every code for physicians&apos; services and outpatient hospital services furnished in an off-campus PBD of a hospital on both the CMS-1500 claim form for physicians&apos; services and the UB-04 form (CMS Form 1450) for hospital outpatient services. We noted that a main provider may treat an off-campus facility as provider-based if certain requirements in <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-413.65">42 CFR 413.65</a> are satisfied, and we define a &#x201C;campus&#x201D; at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-413.65">42 CFR 413.65</a>(a)(2) to be the physical area immediately adjacent to the provider&apos;s main buildings, other areas and<span id="page-66911" class="printed_page" data-page="66911"> </span>structures that are not strictly contiguous to the main buildings but are located within 250 yards of the main buildings, and any other areas determined on an individual case basis, by the CMS regional office, to be part of the provider&apos;s campus.</p>
          <p id="p-1650" data-page="66911">Section 220(a)(1) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (<a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=113&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=93&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub. L. 113-93</a>) added a new subparagraph (M) under section 1848(c)(2) of the Act that granted CMS the authority to engage in data collection to support valuation of services paid under the MPFS. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we indicated that we are seeking more information on the frequency and type of services furnished in PBDs under this authority to improve the accuracy of MPFS practice expense payments for services furnished in off-campus PBDs. We discussed this issue in more detail in the CY 2015 MPFS proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-40333">79 FR 40333</a>). In that discussion, we noted our concerns that our current MPFS practice expense methodology primarily distinguishes between the resources involved in furnishing services in two sites of service: the nonfacility setting and the facility setting. As more physician practices become hospital-based and are treated as off-campus PBDs, we believe it is important to develop an understanding of which practice expense costs typically are incurred by the physicians and practitioners in the setting, which are incurred by the hospital, and whether the facility and nonfacility site-of-service differentials adequately account for the typical resource costs, given these new ownership arrangements.</p>
          <p id="p-1651" data-page="66911">To understand how this trend is affecting Medicare, including the accuracy of payments made through the MPFS, we stated in the proposed rule that we need to develop data to assess the extent to which this shift toward hospital-based physician practices is occurring. Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41013">79 FR 41013</a>), we proposed to collect information on the type and frequency of physicians&apos; services and outpatient hospital services furnished in off-campus PBDs beginning January 1, 2015, in accordance with our authority under section 1848(c)(2)(M) of the Act (as added by section 220(a) of <a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=113&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=93&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub. L. 113-93</a>). As noted above, we proposed to create a HCPCS modifier that is to be reported with every code for physicians&apos; services and outpatient hospital services furnished in an off-campus PBD of a hospital. Under the proposal, the modifier would be reported on both the CMS-1500 claim form for physicians&apos; services and the UB-04 form (CMS Form 1450) for hospital outpatient services. In the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41013">79 FR 41013</a>), we sought additional public comments on whether or not the use of a modifier code is the best mechanism for collecting this service-level data in the hospital outpatient department.</p>
          <p id="p-1652" data-page="66911">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters agreed on the need to collect information on the frequency, type, and payment of services furnished in off-campus PBDs of hospitals. However, several commenters expressed concern that the HCPCS modifier would create additional administrative burden for providers. Many of these commenters stated that the new modifier would require significant changes to hospitals&apos; billing systems, including a separate chargemaster for outpatient off-campus PBDs and training for staff on how to use the new modifier. Many of these commenters suggested that CMS should re-propose a detailed data collection methodology, test it with providers, make adjustments, and allow additional time for implementation. One commenter suggested that CMS withdraw the current proposal and ask the Advisory Panel on Hospital Outpatient Payment (HOP Panel) to develop a proposal for data collection.</p>
          <p id="p-1653" data-page="66911">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> While we understand the commenters&apos; concerns about the additional administrative burden of reporting a new HCPCS modifier, we have weighed the burden of reporting the modifier for each service against the benefit of having data that will allow us to obtain and assess accurate information on the type and frequency of physicians&apos; services and outpatient hospital services furnished in off-campus PBDs. We do not believe that the modifier is excessively burdensome for providers to report. This is especially the case because, under current rules, when billing for services, providers must know where services are performed in order to accurately complete value code 78 of an outpatient claim or the service location portion of a professional claim. However, as discussed later in this section, we agree that a place of service (POS) code on the professional claim allows for the same type of data collection as a modifier on the hospital claim and would be less burdensome than the modifier for practitioner billing. We discuss the timeframe for implementation later in this section. With respect to bringing this proposal to the HOP Panel, we note that such a proposal is outside the scope of the HOP Panel, which is generally charged with advising Medicare on the clinical integrity of APCs and their associate relative payment weights. The proposed modifier is for collecting data and, as structured, does not affect APCs and their associated relative payment weights. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to solicit HOP Panel discussion or recommendations on this proposal on data collection.</p>
          <p id="p-1654" data-page="66911">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Some commenters who were concerned about the administrative burden of the new HCPCS modifier suggested several alternative methods for CMS to collect data on services furnished in off-campus PBDs. Several of these commenters recommended that CMS consider the establishment of a new POS code for professional claims, or for both professional claims and hospital claims, because they believed this approach would be less administratively burdensome than attaching a modifier to each service reported on the claim that was furnished in an off-campus PBD. Some commenters preferred identifying services furnished in off-campus PBDs on the Medicare cost report (CMS-2552-10). Some commenters suggested using provider numbers and addresses to identify off-campus PBDs, or changing the provider enrollment process to be able to track these data. Other commenters suggested creating a new bill type to track outpatient hospital services furnished in off-campus PBDs.</p>
          <p id="p-1655" data-page="66911">Commenters generally recommended that CMS choose the least administratively burdensome approach that would ensure accurate data collection, but did not necessarily agree on what approach would optimally achieve that result. Some commenters believed that a HCPCS modifier would more clearly identify specific services furnished at off-campus PBDs, and would provide better information about the type and level of care furnished. Some commenters believed that a HCPCS modifier would be the least administratively burdensome approach because hospitals and physicians already report a number of claims-based modifiers. Other commenters argued that additional modifiers would increase administrative burden because this approach would increase the modifiers that would need to be considered when billing.</p>
          <p id="p-1656" data-page="66911">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> With respect to creating a new POS code to obtain data on services furnished in off-campus PBDs of a hospital, we note that POS codes are only reported on professional claims and are not included on hospital claims. Therefore, a POS code could not be easily implemented for hospital claims. However, POS codes are already required to be reported on every professional claim and POS 22 is currently used to report when physicians&apos; services are furnished in an<span id="page-66912" class="printed_page" data-page="66912"> </span>outpatient hospital department. (More information on existing POS codes is available on the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/place-of-service-codes/Place_of_Service_Code_Set.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/place-of-service-codes/Place_of_Service_Code_Set.html</a></i>.)</p>
          <p id="p-1657" data-page="66912">Although we considered proposing a new POS code for professional claims to collect data on services furnished in the off-campus PBD setting, we ultimately did not do so, in part because we were aware that previous Government Accountability Office and Office of the Inspector General reports (October 2004, A-05-04-0025; January 2005, A-06-04-00046; July 2010, A-01-09-00503; September 2011, A-01-10-00516) have noted frequent inaccuracies in the reporting of POS codes. In addition, at the time the proposed rule was developed, we had concerns that using a POS code to report this information might not give us the reliable data we are looking to collect, especially if such data were to be crosswalked with hospital claims for the same service, because the hospital claim would have a modifier, not a POS code. However, we have been persuaded by public comments suggesting that use of a POS code would be less administratively burdensome on professional claims than use of a modifier. Specifically, because a POS code is already required on every professional claim, we believe that creating a new POS code to distinguish outpatient hospital services that are furnished on-campus versus off-campus would require less staff training and education than would use of a modifier on the professional claim. In addition, professional claims only have space for four modifiers. While a very small percentage of professional claims have four modifiers, required use of an additional modifier for every professional claim could lead to more occurrences where there would not be space for all applicable modifiers. Unlike hospital claims, we note that a new professional claim is required whenever the place of service changes. That is, even if the same practitioner treats the same patient on the same day in the office and hospital, the services furnished in the office setting must be submitted on one claim with the POS 11 (Office) code, while those furnished in the outpatient hospital department would be submitted on a separate claim with the POS 22 (Outpatient Hospital) code (we note that the POS 22 code will be changing under the final policy). Likewise, if a new POS code were to be created for an off-campus PBD setting, a separate claim for services furnished in that setting would be required relative to a claim for services furnished on the main campus by the same practitioner to the same patient on the same day. Based on public comments and after further consultation with Medicare billing experts, we believe that the use of the POS code on professional claims would be no less accurate than the use of a modifier on professional claims in identifying services furnished in off-campus PBDs. In addition, we believe that the POS code would be less administratively burdensome for practitioners billing using the professional claim because a POS code is already required for every professional claim.</p>
          <p id="p-1658" data-page="66912">With respect to adding new fields to existing claim forms or creating a new bill type, we do not believe that this data collection warrants these measures. We believe that those changes would create greater administrative burden than a HCPCS modifier or POS code, especially because providers are already accustomed to using modifiers and POS codes. Revisions to the claim form to add new fields or an additional bill type would create significant administrative burden to revise claims processing systems and educate providers, which we believe is not necessary, given the availability of a modifier and POS codes. Although providers may not be familiar with this new modifier or any new POS code; because these types of codes already exist generally for hospital and professional claims, providers and suppliers should already have an understanding of these types of codes and how to apply them. Finally, we do not believe that expansions to the claim form or use of a new bill type would provide us with detailed information on exactly which services were furnished in an off-campus PBD versus those furnished on the main campus when those services are furnished on the same day.</p>
          <p id="p-1659" data-page="66912">We also do not believe that we could accurately determine which services are furnished at off-campus PBDs using currently available national provider identifier (NPI) and facility address data. Hospitals are required to report the 9-digit zip code indicating where a service was furnished for purposes of paying properly for physician and anesthesia services paid under the MPFS when that zip code differs from the master address for the hospital on file in CMS claims systems (Pub. 100-04, Transmittal 1681, February 13, 2009). However, the billing zip code for the hospital main campus could be broad enough to incorporate on and off-campus PBDs. Further, a zip code reported in value code 78 does not allow CMS to distinguish between services furnished in different locations on the same date. Therefore, we do not believe that a comparison of the zip code captured in value code 78 and the main campus zip code is sufficiently precise.</p>
          <p id="p-1660" data-page="66912">Finally, while we considered the suggestion that CMS use currently reported Medicare hospital cost report (CMS-2552-10) data to identify services furnished at off-campus PBDs, we note that although aggregate data on services furnished in different settings must be reported through the appropriate cost center, we would not be able to obtain the service-specific level of detail that we would be able to obtain from claims data.</p>
          <p id="p-1661" data-page="66912">We will take under consideration the suggestion that CMS create a way for hospitals to report their acquisition of off-campus PBDs through the enrollment process, although this information, as currently reported, like many of the suggestions above, would not allow us to know exactly which services are furnished in off-campus PBDs and which services are furnished on the hospital&apos;s main campus when a hospital provides both on the same day.</p>
          <p id="p-1662" data-page="66912">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Commenters noted that the proposed modifier would not allow CMS to know the precise location of the off-campus PBDs for billed services or when services are furnished at different off-campus PBD locations in the same day.</p>
          <p id="p-1663" data-page="66912">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We agree that neither the proposed modifier nor a POS code provides precise information on the specific location of each off-campus PBD for each furnished service. However, we believe having information on the type and frequency of services furnished at all off-campus locations will assist CMS in better understanding the distribution of services between on-campus locations and off-campus locations.</p>
          <p id="p-1664" data-page="66912">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> MedPAC believed there may be some value in collecting data on services furnished in off-campus PBDs to validate the accuracy of site-of-service reporting when the physician&apos;s office is off-campus but bills as an outpatient department. MedPAC indicated that any data collection effort should not prevent the development of policies to align payment rates across settings. MedPAC encouraged CMS to seek legislative authority to set equal payment rates across settings for evaluation and management office visits and other select services.</p>
          <p id="p-1665" data-page="66912">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank MedPAC for its support of our data collection efforts to better inform the frequency and types of services that are being furnished in off-campus PBDs.<span id="page-66913" class="printed_page" data-page="66913"> </span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-1666" data-page="66913">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters suggested that providers would not be able to accurately apply the new modifier by the January 1, 2015 implementation timeline and recommended a 1-year delay before providers would be required to apply the modifier to services furnished at off-campus PBDs. Some commenters requested only a 6-month delay in implementation. Commenters indicated that significant revisions to internal billing processes would require additional time to implement.</p>
          <p id="p-1667" data-page="66913">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Although we believe that the customary January 1st effective date that applies to most policies adopted in the final rules with comment period for both the MPFS and the OPPS would provide sufficient lead time, we understand the commenters&apos; concerns with the proposed timeline for implementation, given that the new reporting requirements may require changes to billing systems as well as education and training for staff. Accordingly, although we are finalizing our proposal to create a HCPCS modifier for hospital services furnished in an off-campus PBD setting, we are adopting a voluntary reporting period of the new HCPCS modifier for 1 year. That is, reporting the new HCPCS modifier for services furnished at an off-campus PBD will not be mandatory until January 1, 2016, in order to allow providers time to make systems changes, test these changes, and train staff on use of the new modifier before reporting is required. We welcome early reporting of the modifier and believe a full year of preparation should provide hospitals with sufficient time to modify their systems for accurate reporting. With respect to the POS code for professional claims, we will request two new POS codes to replace POS code 22 (Hospital Outpatient) through the POS Workgroup and expect that it will take some time for these new codes to be established. Once the new POS codes are ready and integrated into CMS claims systems, practitioners would be required to use them, as applicable. More information on the availability of the new POS codes will be forthcoming in subregulatory guidance. However, we do not expect the new POS codes to be available prior to July 1, 2015. There will be no voluntary reporting period of the POS codes for applicable professional claims because each professional claim requires a POS code in order to be accepted by Medicare. However, we do not view this to be problematic because we intend to give prior notice on the POS coding changes and, as many of the commenters noted, because practitioners are already accustomed to using a POS code on every claim they submit.</p>
          <p id="p-1668" data-page="66913">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters expressed concern that this data collection would eventually lead to equalizing payment for similar services furnished in the nonfacility setting and the off-campus PBD setting. Several commenters noted that the trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices is due to efforts to better integrate care delivery and suggested that CMS weigh the benefits of care integration when deciding payment changes. Some commenters suggested that CMS use these data to equalize payment for similar services between these two settings. These commenters suggested that there is little difference in costs and care between the two settings that would warrant the difference in payment. Several of these commenters highlighted beneficiary cost-sharing as one reason for site-neutral payment, noting that the total payment amount for outpatient services is generally higher than the total payment amount for those same services when furnished in a physician&apos;s office.</p>
          <p id="p-1669" data-page="66913">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate these comments. At this time, we are only finalizing a data collection in this final rule with comment period. We did not propose and, therefore, are not finalizing any adjustment to payments furnished in the off-campus PBD setting.</p>
          <p id="p-1670" data-page="66913">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter noted that the CMS proposal would not provide additional information on how a physician practice billed prior to becoming an off-campus PBD, which would be important for analyzing the impact of this trend.</p>
          <p id="p-1671" data-page="66913">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We agree that understanding physician billing patterns prior to becoming an off-campus PBD is important in analyzing the impact of this trend, and we will continue to evaluate ways to analyze claims data to gather this information. We believe that collecting data using the additional modifier and POS code finalized in this final rule with comment period will be an important tool in furthering this analysis.</p>
          <p id="p-1672" data-page="66913">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Some commenters suggested that the term &#x201C;off-campus&#x201D; be better defined. Commenters asked how billing would occur for hospitals with multiple campuses because the CMS definition of campus references main buildings and does not include remote locations. The commenters maintained that remote locations are not the same as off-campus departments and that remote campuses furnish both inpatient and outpatient hospital services, in contrast to individual hospital departments. The commenters argued that these types of locations are not ones that were formerly a physician office practice, and furnish completely different types of services than a physician office. One commenter also asked whether the modifier is intended to cover services furnished in freestanding emergency departments.</p>
          <p id="p-1673" data-page="66913">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> For purposes of the modifier and the POS codes we are finalizing in this final rule with comment period, we define &#x201C;campus&#x201D; using the definition at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-413.65">42 CFR 413.65</a>(a)(2) to be the physical area immediately adjacent to the provider&apos;s main buildings, other areas and structures that are not strictly contiguous to the main buildings but are located within 250 yards of the main buildings, and any other areas determined on an individual case basis, by the CMS regional office, to be part of the provider&apos;s campus. Our intent is to capture outpatient services furnished off of the hospital&apos;s main campus and off of any other hospital campuses. The term &#x201C;remote location of a hospital&#x201D; is defined at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-413.65">42 CFR 413.65</a>(a)(2). Under these regulations, a &#x201C;remote location&#x201D; includes a hospital campus other than the main hospital campus. Specifically, a remote location is &#x201C;a facility or an organization that is either created by, or acquired by, a hospital that is a main provider for the purpose of furnishing inpatient hospital services under the name, ownership, and financial and administrative control of the main provider. . . .&#x201D; Therefore, we agree with the commenter that remote locations of the hospital should not be required to report the modifier nor should practitioners be required to report the off-campus POS code in these settings. This term &#x201C;remote location&#x201D; does not include &#x201C;satellite&#x201D; locations of a hospital, but because a satellite facility is one that provides inpatient services in a building also used by another hospital, or in one or more entire buildings located on the same campus as buildings used by another hospital, we also are not requiring satellite facilities to report the modifier or the POS codes. Satellite facilities are described in the regulations at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-412.22">42 CFR 412.22</a>(h). Accordingly, reporting of the modifier and POS codes would be required for outpatient services furnished in PBDs beyond 250 yards from the main campus of the hospital, excluding services furnished in a remote location or satellite facility of the hospital.</p>

          <p id="p-1674" data-page="66913">We also appreciate the comment on emergency departments. We do not intend for hospitals to report the new modifier for services furnished in an emergency department that is provider-<span id="page-66914" class="printed_page" data-page="66914"> </span>based to a hospital. We note that there is already a POS code for the emergency department, POS 23 (emergency room-hospital), and this code would continue to be used for emergency department services. That is, the new off-campus PBD code that will be created for purposes of this data collection would not apply to hospital emergency department services. Hospitals that have questions about which departments are considered to be &#x201C;off-campus PBDs&#x201D; should review additional guidance that CMS releases on this policy and work with the appropriate CMS regional office if individual, specific questions remain.</p>
          <p id="p-1675" data-page="66914">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters asked for clarification on when to report the modifier for services furnished both on-campus and off-campus on the same day. The commenters provided several scenarios of visits and diagnostic services furnished on the same day.</p>
          <p id="p-1676" data-page="66914">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The location where the service is actually furnished would dictate the use of the modifier, regardless of where the order for services initiated. We expect the modifier and the POS code for off-campus PBDs to be reported in locations in which the hospital expends resources to furnish the service in an off-campus PBD setting. For example, hospitals would not report the modifier for a diagnostic test that is ordered by a practitioner who is located in an off-campus PBD when the service is actually furnished on the main campus of the hospital. This issue does not impact use of the POS codes because practitioners submit a different claim for each POS where they furnish services for a specific beneficiary.</p>
          <p id="p-1677" data-page="66914">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters asked for clarification on whether their entity constitutes a PBD.</p>
          <p id="p-1678" data-page="66914">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> PBDs are departments of the hospital that meet the criteria specified in regulations at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-413.65">42 CFR 413.65</a>. Questions about PBDs may be directed to the appropriate CMS regional office.</p>
          <p id="p-1679" data-page="66914">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter recommended that CMS publish the data it acquires through adoption of this modifier.</p>
          <p id="p-1680" data-page="66914">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Data collected through the new HCPCS modifier would be part of the Medicare Limited Data Set and would be available to the public for purchase along with the remainder of the Limited Data Set. Similarly, professional claims data with revised POS coding would be available as a standard analytic file for purchase.</p>
          <p id="p-1681" data-page="66914">In summary, after consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing our proposal with modifications. For hospital claims, we are creating a HCPCS modifier that is to be reported with every code for outpatient hospital services furnished in an off-campus PBD of a hospital. This code will not be required to be reported for remote locations of a hospital defined at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-412.65">42 CFR 412.65</a>, satellite facilities of a hospital defined at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-412.22">42 CFR 412.22</a>(h), or for services furnished in an emergency department. This 2-digit modifier will be added to the HCPCS annual file as of January 1, 2015, with the label &#x201C;PO,&#x201D; the short descriptor &#x201C;Serv/proc off-campus pbd,&#x201D; and the long descriptor &#x201C;Services, procedures and/or surgeries furnished at off-campus provider-based outpatient departments.&#x201D; Reporting of this new modifier will be voluntary for 1 year (CY 2015), with reporting required beginning on January 1, 2016. Additional instruction and provider education will be forthcoming in subregulatory guidance.</p>
          <p id="p-1682" data-page="66914">For professional claims, instead of finalizing a HCPCS modifier, in response to public comments, we will be deleting current POS code 22 (outpatient hospital department) and establishing two new POS codes&#x2014;one to identify outpatient services furnished in on-campus, remote, or satellite locations of a hospital, and one to identify services furnished in an off-campus PBD hospital setting. We will maintain the separate POS code 23 (Emergency room-hospital) to identify services furnished in an emergency department of the hospital. These new POS codes will be required to be reported as soon as they become available. However, advanced notice of the availability of these codes will be shared publicly as soon as practicable.</p>

<h4><a name="272"></a>B. ASCQR Program Quality Measures</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Considerations in the Selection of ASCQR Program Quality Measures</b></p>
          <p id="p-2253" data-page="66967">We refer readers to the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68493">77 FR 68493</a> through 68494) for a detailed discussion of the priorities we consider for ASCQR Program quality measure selection.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Policy for Removal of Quality Measures From the ASCQR Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-2254" data-page="66967">We previously adopted a policy to retain measures from the previous year&apos;s ASCQR Program measure set for subsequent years&apos; measure sets except when they are removed, suspended, or replaced as indicated (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74504">76 FR 74504</a>; <a href="/citation/77-FR-68494">77 FR 68494</a> through 68495; <a href="/citation/78-FR-75122">78 FR 75122</a>). In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41045">79 FR 41045</a>), we proposed a process for removing adopted measures.</p>
          <p id="p-2255" data-page="66967">In the FY 2010 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/74-FR-43863">74 FR 43863</a> through 43865), we finalized a process for immediate retirement (a term we later changed to &#x201C;removal&#x201D;) of RHQDAPU Program (now referred to as the Hospital IQR Program) measures based on evidence that the continued use of the measure as specified raised patient safety concerns. We stated that we believe immediate retirement of quality measures should occur when the clinical evidence suggests that continued collection of the data may result in harm to patients. For example, we removed the AMI-6: Beta Blocker at Arrival measure from the Hospital IQR Program because it encouraged care that raised potential safety concerns according to newly published research suggesting that beta-blockers could increase mortality risks for certain patient populations (<a href="/citation/74-FR-43863">74 FR 43863</a>). Under such circumstances, we may not be able to wait until the annual rulemaking cycle or until we have had the opportunity to obtain input from the public to retire a measure because of the need to discourage potentially harmful practices, which may result from continued collection of the measure.</p>

          <p id="p-2256" data-page="66967">In these situations, we would promptly retire the measure and notify hospitals and the public of the retirement of the measure and the reasons for its retirement through the usual communication channels. Further, we would confirm the retirement of the measure that was the subject of immediate retirement in the next program rulemaking. Finally, we stated that, in other circumstances where we do not believe that continued use of a measure raises specific safety concerns, we intend to use the rulemaking process to retire the measure. For the same reasons stated for the Hospital IQR Program, we believe that this process also would be appropriate for the ASCQR Program. Therefore, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41045">79 FR 41045</a>), we proposed to adopt this same removal process for the ASCQR Program. Under this process, we would immediately remove an ASCQR Program measure based on evidence that the continued use of the measure as specified raised patient safety concerns. In these situations, we would promptly remove the measure and notify ASCs and the public of the removal of the measure and the reasons for its removal through the ASCQR Program ListServe and the ASCQR Program QualityNet Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier2&amp;cid=1228772879650" class="external wrap">http://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier2&amp;amp;cid=1228772879650</a></i>. Further, we would confirm the removal of the measure that was the subject of immediate removal in the next OPPS/ASC rulemaking.</p>
          <p id="p-2257" data-page="66967">For situations where we do not believe the continued use of a measure raises specific safety concerns, we proposed to use the regular rulemaking process to remove a measure to allow for public comment. In the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/77-FR-53505">77 FR 53505</a> through 53506), we listed the criteria we have used to determine whether to remove measures from the Hospital IQR Program. These criteria are: (1) Measure performance among hospitals is so high and unvarying that meaningful distinctions and improvements in performance can no longer be made (&#x201C;topped out&#x201D; measures); (2) availability of alternative measures with a stronger relationship to patient outcomes; (3) a measure does not align with current clinical guidelines or practice; (4) the availability of a more broadly applicable (across settings, populations, or conditions) measure for the topic; (5) the availability of a measure that is more proximal in time to desired patient outcomes for the particular topic; (6) the availability of a measure that is more strongly associated with desired patient outcomes for the particular topic; and (7) collection or public reporting of a measure leads to negative unintended consequences other than patient harm. These criteria were suggested through public comment on proposals for the Hospital IQR Program, and we agreed that these criteria should be considered in evaluating the Hospital IQR Program quality measures for removal (<a href="/citation/75-FR-53506">75 FR 53506</a>). We believe that these criteria also are applicable in evaluating ASCQR Program quality measures for removal because we have found them useful for evaluating measures in the Hospital IQR Program and our other quality reporting programs, which share similar goals to the ASCQR Program. Accordingly, we proposed to adopt these measure removal criteria for the ASCQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2258" data-page="66967">We invited public comment on these proposals.</p>
          <p id="p-2259" data-page="66967">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters supported CMS&apos; proposed measure removal policy and commended CMS for fostering an aligned approach for measures removal criteria across our quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs.</p>
          <p id="p-2260" data-page="66967">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for their support. We agree that for consistency, an approach to removing measures should be aligned across our quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs to the extent possible.</p>
          <p id="p-2261" data-page="66967">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter supported CMS&apos; proposal to immediately remove measures that raise public safety concerns. The commenter recommended that CMS notify ASCs by mail and also post notification on the CMS Web site on the ASCQR Web page under the &#x201C;Announcements&#x201D; heading, in addition to communication through the ASCQR Program ListServe and the QualityNet Web site.</p>
          <p id="p-2262" data-page="66967">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenter for supporting our proposal and the suggestions for notifying ASCs. Past experience indicates that the current notification process using the QualityNet Web site and the ASCQR Program ListServe is a fast, efficient, and effective means of publicly communicating information about the ASCQR Program, and using this process would be consistent with how other ASCQR Program information is provided. Therefore, we are not including these additional modes of communication with ASCs for purposes of ASCQR Program notices at this time.</p>
          <p id="p-2263" data-page="66967">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter believed that proposed measure removal criteria (2) (availability of alternative measures<span id="page-66968" class="printed_page" data-page="66968"> </span>with a stronger relationship to patient outcomes) and (6) (the availability of a measure that is more strongly associated with desired patient outcomes for the particular topic) are duplicative, and that criterion (2) should read as &#x201C;performance or improvement on a measure does not result in better patient outcomes.&#x201D; The commenter also suggested that criterion (3) (a measure does not align with current clinical guidelines or practice) and criterion (7) (collection or public reporting of a measure leads to negative unintended consequences other than patient harm) should be applied to all measures, but the remaining criteria should be applied more selectively on a measure-by-measure basis.</p>
          <p id="p-2264" data-page="66968">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenter for these recommendations. We disagree with the commenter that criterion (2) and criterion (6) are the same and that criterion (2) should be reworded as suggested. Criterion (2) applies when there is more than one alternative measure with a stronger relationship to patient outcomes that is available, and criterion (6) applies where there is only one measure that is strongly and specifically associated with desired patient outcomes for the particular topic that is available. For criterion (2), there may be different alternative measures available that meet this criterion to different degrees. The suggestion to rephrase criterion (2) to read &#x201C;performance or improvement on a measure does not result in better patient outcomes&#x201D; would change the meaning of criterion (2).</p>
          <p id="p-2265" data-page="66968">As we discuss earlier, the measure removal criteria have been developed through public comment on proposals for the Hospital IQR Program. We believe that these criteria also are applicable in evaluating the ASCQR Program quality measures for removal, because we have found them useful for evaluating measures in the Hospital IQR Program as well as other quality reporting programs, which share similar goals to the ASCQR Program. We note that we did not propose any changes to criterion (2) in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. Further, based on our experience with the Hospital IQR Program, we believe criterion (2) is appropriate and do not believe that additional refinement is necessary. Therefore, we are not revising this criterion. We thank the commenters for their views and will take them into consideration as we continuously assess these criteria.</p>
          <p id="p-2266" data-page="66968">With respect to the commenter&apos;s suggestion that criteria (3) and (7) apply to all measures but the remaining criteria be applied more selectively on a case-by-case basis, we disagree with respect to selective application of the criteria. We intend for all the criteria, including criteria (3) and (7), to apply to all measures to the extent possible. In any given situation, we will focus only on removal criteria that are relevant to a particular set of circumstances. If more than one of the measure removal criteria appears to be relevant, we intend to take a balanced approach in assessing the value of each of the different criteria in a given situation before removing any measure.</p>
          <p id="p-2267" data-page="66968">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal without modification on the measure removal process and criteria. Specifically, we will immediately remove an ASCQR Program measure based on evidence that the continued use of the measure as specified raises patient safety concerns. In these situations, we will promptly remove the measure and notify ASCs and the public of the removal of the measure and the reasons for its removal through the ASCQR Program ListServe and the ASCQR Program QualityNet Web site. Further, we will confirm the removal of the measure that was the subject of immediate removal in the next OPPS/ASC rulemaking.</p>
          <p id="p-2268" data-page="66968">For situations where we do not believe the continued use of a measure raises specific safety concerns, we will use the regular rulemaking process to remove a measure to allow for public comment. In these situations, we will use the following criteria to determine whether to remove the measures from the ASCQR Program: (1) measure performance among ASCs is so high and unvarying that meaningful distinctions and improvements in performance can no longer be made (&#x201C;topped out&#x201D; measures); (2) availability of alternative measures with a stronger relationship to patient outcomes; (3) a measure does not align with current clinical guidelines or practice; (4) the availability of a more broadly applicable (across settings, populations, or conditions) measure for the topic; (5) the availability of a measure that is more proximal in time to desired patient outcomes for the particular topic; (6) the availability of a measure that is more strongly associated with desired patient outcomes for the particular topic; and (7) collection or public reporting of a measure leads to negative unintended consequences other than patient harm.</p>
          <br><p><b>3. Criteria for Removal of &#x201C;Topped-Out&#x201D; Measures</b></p>
          <p id="p-2269" data-page="66968">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41045">79 FR 41045</a> through 41046), we proposed to define criteria for when we would consider a measure to be &#x201C;topped-out.&#x201D; A measure is &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; when measure performance among ASCs is so high and unvarying that meaningful distinctions and improvements in performance can no longer be made (&#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; measures). We do not believe that measuring ASC performance on &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; measures provides meaningful information on the quality of care provided by ASCs. We further believe that quality measures, once &#x201C;topped-out,&#x201D; represent care standards that have been widely adopted by ASCs. We believe such measures should be considered for removal from the ASCQR Program because their associated reporting burden may outweigh the value of the quality information they provide.</p>
          <p id="p-2270" data-page="66968">Specifically, we proposed that a measure under the ASCQR Program is &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; when it meets both of the following criteria:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-2271" data-page="66968"> Statistically indistinguishable performance at the 75th and 90th percentiles; and</li>
          <li id="p-2272" data-page="66968"> A truncated coefficient of variation less than or equal to 0.10.</li>
</ul>

          <p id="p-2273" data-page="66968">To identify if a measure has statistically indistinguishable performance at the 75th and 90th percentiles, we would determine whether the difference between the 75th and 90th percentiles for an ASC&apos;s measure is within two times the standard error of the full dataset. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a descriptive statistic that expresses the standard deviation as a percentage of the sample mean; this provides a statistic that is independent of the units of observation. Applied to this analysis, a large CV would indicate a broad distribution of individual ASC scores, with large and presumably meaningful differences between ASCs in relative performance. A small CV would indicate that the distribution of individual facility scores is clustered tightly around the mean value, indicating that it is not useful to draw distinctions among individual ASCs on measure performance. The truncated CV excludes observations whose rates are below the 5th percentile and above the 95th percentile; this avoids undue effects of the highest and lowest outlier values, which, if included, can inappropriately widen the dispersion of the distribution. These same criteria for when we would consider a measure to be &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; have been adopted in the Hospital VBP Program (<a href="/citation/79-FR-50055">79 FR 50055</a>), the Hospital IQR Program (<a href="/citation/79-FR-50204">79 FR 50204</a>), and the Hospital OQR Program (section XIII.C.2 of this final rule with comment period).<span id="page-66969" class="printed_page" data-page="66969"> </span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-2274" data-page="66969">We invited public comment on this proposal.</p>
          <p id="p-2275" data-page="66969">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters supported CMS&apos; proposed &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; criteria for measure removal and the alignment of these criteria across the Hospital IQR and Hospital VBP Programs. One commenter suggested that CMS refine the first criterion to ensure that measures exhibit sufficient lack of variability before they are removed. Several commenters suggested that CMS have a mechanism in place to identify a significant decline in adherence rates after a measure has been removed.</p>
          <p id="p-2276" data-page="66969">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for their support of the proposed topped-out criteria. We expect ASCs to always follow appropriate standards-of-care and clinical guidelines, regardless of whether a quality measure exists. We believe that ASCs are committed to providing quality care to patients, and we do not have any indication that ASCs will stop doing so when measures are removed.</p>
          <p id="p-2277" data-page="66969">While it is possible that removing a measure could result in reduced performance, we have guarded against this possibility by setting topped-out criteria that evidence very high, unvarying levels of performance. Further, we intend to continue to work with quality measurement stakeholders to ensure that performance does not decline significantly after removing a measure. However, we must balance the costs of continued monitoring of a successful measure with high levels of performance with the adoption of other measures where there are opportunities for improvement in clinical quality.</p>
          <p id="p-2278" data-page="66969">Regarding the suggestion to further refine the first criterion, which refers to determining that a measure exhibits sufficient lack of variability before removal, we proposed topped-out criteria that evidence very high, unvarying levels of performance and, at this time, do not believe additional refinement that would make the criteria more stringent is necessary. However, we will consider the need for refinement and, if we determine changes may be necessary, we will propose such changes in future rulemaking. In addition, we will not use our topped-out criteria exclusively when evaluating the retention or removal of a measure; a measure that meets our topped-out criteria could be retained for other program reasons as discussed below.</p>
          <p id="p-2279" data-page="66969">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter cautioned against removing measures solely based on the proposed &#x201C;topped out&#x201D; criteria, and was concerned that these criteria might lead to the removal of valuable program measures. The commenter cited the example of patient safety measures and surgical site infection rates, which are intended to drive toward and sustain zero harm. The commenter believed that these types of measures could have performance scores that meet the topped out criteria over time. However, the commenter believed they would have enduring value to consumers and providers. Some commenters urged CMS to assess &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; measures individually, that is, case-by-case, and in a broader context before removing them from the ASCQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2280" data-page="66969">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We agree that some measures that are quantitatively &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; may still be appropriate for other reasons. Therefore, as we do for the Hospital IQR Program and the Hospital VBP Program, and consistent with our discussion above in section XIV.B.3. of this final rule with comment period, we will evaluate several factors in considering the removal of measures for the ASCQR Program. We will assess the benefits of retaining a measure on a case-by-case basis before proposing to remove a measure from a quality data reporting program and will not remove a measure solely on the basis of meeting any specific criterion.</p>
          <p id="p-2281" data-page="66969">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter requested clarification whether ASC-5: Prophylactic IV antibiotic timing is topped-out because this measure is topped-out in the HOPD setting.</p>
          <p id="p-2282" data-page="66969">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenter for this request. In response, we have reviewed data collected under the ASCQR Program. Our analysis indicated that performance for the prophylactic IV antibiotic timing measure is relatively high. However, because we continue to have some facilities with completeness of reporting issues and data have been collected for a relatively short time, we do not believe we have sufficient data to support a topped out analysis for the purposes of measure removal for the ASCQR Program at this time. Furthermore, we believe that a prophylactic antibiotic timing measure remains relevant clinically or for quality improvement purposes under the ASCQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2283" data-page="66969">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing the proposed &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; criteria. Specifically, we are finalizing a policy that a measure under the ASCQR Program is &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; when it meets both of the following criteria: (1) Statistically indistinguishable performance at the 75th and 90th percentiles; and (2) a truncated coefficient of variation less than or equal to 0.10. To identify if a measure has statistically indistinguishable performance at the 75th and 90th percentiles, we will determine whether the difference between the 75th and 90th percentiles for an ASC&apos;s measure is within two times the standard error of the full dataset.</p>
          <p id="p-2284" data-page="66969">As we do for the Hospital IQR Program and the Hospital VBP Program, and consistent with our discussion above in section XIV.B.3. of this final rule with comment period, we will evaluate several factors in considering the removal of measures for the ASCQR Program. We will assess the benefits of retaining a measure on a case-by-case basis before proposing to remove a measure from the ASCQR Program and will not remove a measure solely on the basis of meeting any specific criterion.</p>

We did not propose to remove any measures from the ASCQR Program in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. Further, there is no evidence that continued use of the measures as specified raises patient safety concerns that would require immediate removal of the measures based on the process we are finalizing in this final rule with comment period.

          <br><p><b>5. New ASCQR Program Quality Measure for the CY 2018 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years</b></p>
          <p id="p-2290" data-page="66970">We refer readers to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75124">78 FR 75124</a>) for a detailed discussion of our approach to ASCQR measure selection. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41046">79 FR 41046</a> through 41048), we proposed to adopt one new claims-based measure into the ASCQR Program for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years: ASC-12: Facility Seven-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy.</p>
          <p id="p-2291" data-page="66970">Colonoscopy is the most commonly performed ambulatory surgery in the United States.<sup><a id="citation-28" name="#footnote-28" rel="footnote">
            [28]
          </a></sup>
            The most recent data available indicate that, in 2002 alone, physicians performed an estimated 14 million colonoscopies in the United States.<sup><a id="citation-29" name="#footnote-29" rel="footnote">
            [29]
          </a></sup>

            Colonoscopies are associated with a range of well-described and potentially preventable adverse events that can lead to hospital visits, repeat procedures, or surgical intervention for treatment, including colonic perforation, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and cardiopulmonary events such as hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia, and cardiac arrhythmias. While hospital visits are generally unexpected after outpatient colonoscopy, the literature suggests that the majority of these visits occur within the first 7 days. <sup class="E-51">30 31 32</sup>

            Reported hospital visit rates after outpatient colonoscopy range from 0.8 to 1.0 percent at 7 to 14 days post procedure, and from 2.4 to 3.8 percent at 30 days post procedure. <sup class="E-51">33 34 35</sup>
            Some adverse events such as bleeding occur after day 7, but based on input from clinical experts, public comment, and empirical analyses, we concluded that unplanned hospital visits within 7 days is the optimal outcome to ensure capture of procedure-related adverse events and to minimize capture of hospital visits unrelated to the procedure. This measure provides the opportunity for ASCs to improve quality of care and to lower the rates of adverse events leading to hospital visits after outpatient colonoscopy; this would encourage ASCs to achieve the outcome rates of the best performers.</p>
          
          
          
          

          <p id="p-2300" data-page="66970">We believe it is important to reduce adverse patient outcomes associated with preparation for colonoscopy, the procedure itself, and follow-up care. Therefore, we proposed to include the ASC-12: Facility Seven-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy measure, which is calculated from paid Medicare FFS claims, in the ASCQR Program for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. We expect the measure would promote improvement in patient care over time because transparency in publicly reporting<span id="page-66971" class="printed_page" data-page="66971"> </span>measure scores would make patient unplanned hospital visits (emergency department visits, observation stays, and inpatient admissions) following colonoscopies more visible to ASCs and patients and incentivize ASCs to incorporate quality improvement activities in order to reduce these visits. ASCs are often unaware of complications following colonoscopy for which patients visit the hospital.<sup><a id="citation-36" name="#footnote-36" rel="footnote">
            [36]
          </a></sup>
            This risk-standardized quality measure would address this information gap and promote quality improvement by providing feedback to facilities and physicians, as well as transparency for patients on the rates and variation across facilities in unplanned hospital visits after colonoscopy.</p>
          
          <p id="p-2302" data-page="66971">The outcome measured in the ASC-12 measure is all-cause, unplanned hospital visits (admissions, observation stays, and emergency department visits) within 7 days of an outpatient colonoscopy procedure. The measure score, also referred to as the facility-level risk-standardized hospital visit rate, is derived from the calculation of the ratio of the numerator to the denominator multiplied by the crude rate. The numerator is the number of predicted (meaning adjusted actual) hospital visits, which is the number of unplanned hospital visits within 7 days of colonoscopy that the facility is predicted to have based on its case-mix. The denominator is the number of expected hospital visits, which is the number of unplanned hospital visits the facility is expected to have based on the nation&apos;s performance with the facility&apos;s case-mix. The crude rate is the national unadjusted number of patients who had a hospital visit post-colonoscopy among all patients who had a colonoscopy.</p>

          <p id="p-2303" data-page="66971">Based on discussions with clinical and technical panel experts, the measure excludes colonoscopies for patients undergoing concomitant high-risk upper GI endoscopy because these patients are at a higher risk for hospital visits than patients undergoing a typical colonoscopy, and patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or diverticulitis in the year preceding the colonoscopy because we likely could not fully characterize and adjust for their pre-procedure risk of needing a post-procedure hospital visit or identify whether these admissions are planned or unplanned. The measure also excludes procedures for patients who lack continuous enrollment in Medicare FFS Parts A and B in the first month after the procedure to ensure all patients included in the analysis have complete data available for outcome assessment. The statistical risk adjustment model includes 15 clinically relevant risk-adjustment variables that are strongly associated with risk of hospital visits within 7 days following a colonoscopy. Additional methodology details and information obtained from public comment for measure development are available at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/HospitalQualityInits/Measure-Methodology.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/HospitalQualityInits/Measure-Methodology.html</a></i>.</p>

          <p id="p-2304" data-page="66971">Section 1890A of the Act requires the Secretary to establish a pre-rulemaking process with respect to the selection of certain categories of quality and efficiency measures. Under section 1890A(a)(2) of the Act, the Secretary must make available to the public by December 1 of each year a list of quality and efficiency measures that the Secretary is considering for the Medicare program. The measure that we proposed was reviewed by the MAP and was included on a publicly available document entitled &#x201C;MAP Pre-Rulemaking Report: 2014 Recommendations on Measures for More than 20 Federal Programs&#x201D; (formerly referred to as the &#x201C;List of Measures Under Consideration&#x201D;) on the NQF Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2014/01/MAP_Pre-Rulemaking_Report__2014_Recommendations_on_Measures_for_More_than_20_Federal_Programs.aspx" class="external wrap">http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2014/01/MAP_Pre-Rulemaking_Report__2014_Recommendations_on_Measures_for_More_than_20_Federal_Programs.aspx</a></i> (&#x201C;MAP Report&#x201D;). We note that, at the time the measure was listed on the &#x201C;MAP Pre-Rulemaking Report: 2014 Recommendations on Measures for More than 20 Federal Programs,&#x201D; it was named &#x201C;High-Acuity Care Visits after Outpatient Colonoscopy Procedure.&#x201D; The MAP conditionally supported this measure for the ASCQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2305" data-page="66971">The MAP Report stated that the measure &#x201C;[s]hould be submitted for and receive NQF endorsement; Measure is promising but needs further development&#x201D; (p. 187). Further, the MAP Report stated that the measure &#x201C;would provide valuable outcome information to inform consumer decision and drive quality improvement&#x201D; and that the &#x201C;NQF endorsement process would resolve questions about the reliability and validity of the measure.&#x201D; The MAP also stated that NQF endorsement would resolve questions about &#x201C;the feasibility of the algorithm for attributing claims data in light of possible effects of the Medicare three-day payment window&#x201D; (p. 187, MAP Report). However, this concern with Medicare Part A hospital payments relates to the Hospital OQR Program and not the ASCQR Program. As required under section 1890A(a)(4) of the Act, we considered the input and recommendations provided by the MAP in selecting measures to propose for the ASCQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2306" data-page="66971">We believe we have addressed the concerns raised by the MAP to the greatest extent possible. The measure was submitted to NQF for endorsement on February 21, 2014. The measure is well-defined and precisely specified for consistent implementation within and between organizations that will allow for comparability. Reliability testing demonstrated the measure data elements produced were repeatable; that is, the same results were produced a high proportion of the time when assessed in the same population in the same time period. Validity testing demonstrated that the measure data elements produce measure scores that correctly reflect the quality of care provided and that adequately identify differences in quality.</p>
          <p id="p-2307" data-page="66971">Currently, there are no publicly available quality of care reports for ASCs that conduct outpatient colonoscopies. Therefore, adoption of this measure provides an opportunity to enhance the information available to patients choosing among ASCs that offer this elective procedure. We believe this measure would reduce adverse patient outcomes associated with preparation for colonoscopy, the procedure itself, and follow-up care by capturing and making more visible to ASCs and patients all unplanned hospital visits following the procedure. In addition, providing outcome rates to ASCs would make visible to clinicians meaningful quality differences and incentivize improvement.</p>

          <p id="p-2308" data-page="66971">Sections 1833(i)(7)(B) and 1833(t)(17)(C)(i) of the Act, when read together, require the Secretary, except as the Secretary may otherwise provide, to develop measures appropriate for the measurement of the quality of care furnished by ASCs, that reflect consensus among affected parties and, to the extent feasible and practicable, that include measures set forth by one or more national consensus building entities. As stated in the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74465">76 FR 74465</a> and 74505), we believe that consensus among affected parties can be reflected through means other than NQF endorsement, including consensus achieved during the measure development process, consensus shown through broad acceptance and use of measures, and consensus through public comment. We believe this proposed measure meets these statutory<span id="page-66972" class="printed_page" data-page="66972"> </span>requirements. We believe that this measure is appropriate for the measurement of quality of care furnished by ASCs because this procedure is commonly performed in ASCs and, as discussed above, can signify important issues in the care being provided in ASCs. We also believe this measure reflects consensus among affected parties because the MAP, which represents stakeholder groups, reviewed and conditionally supported the measure, and stated that it &#x201C;would provide valuable outcome information to inform consumer decision and drive quality improvement.&#x201D; Further, the measure was subject to public comment during the MAP and measure development processes, with some public commenters agreeing with the MAP&apos;s conclusions on the measure (p. 187, MAP Report, January 2014; <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2014/01/MAP_Pre-Rulemaking_Report__2014_Recommendations_on_Measures_for_More_than_20_Federal_Programs.aspx" class="external wrap">http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2014/01/MAP_Pre-Rulemaking_Report__2014_Recommendations_on_Measures_for_More_than_20_Federal_Programs.aspx</a></i>).</p>
          <p id="p-2309" data-page="66972">As discussed above, the statute also requires the Secretary, except as the Secretary may otherwise provide, to include measures set forth by one or more national consensus building entities to the extent feasible and practicable. This measure is not NQF-endorsed; however, as noted above, this measure is currently undergoing the NQF endorsement process. We note that sections 1833(i)(7)(B) and (t)(17) of the Act do not require that each measure we adopt for the ASCQR Program be endorsed by a national consensus building entity, or by the NQF specifically. Further, under section 1833(i)(7)(B) of the Act, section 1833(t)(17)(C)(i) of the Act, which contains this requirement, applies to the ASCQR Program, except as the Secretary may otherwise provide. Under this provision, the Secretary has further authority to adopt nonendorsed measures.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters urged CMS not to adopt ASC-12 until it is NQF-endorsed. Several of these commenters also noted that the MAP supported this measure on condition of NQF-endorsement, noting that the NQF process would resolve a number of questions about the reliability, validity and feasibility of this measure. These commenters requested that, in general, CMS only include measures in the ASCQR Program that have been NQF-endorsed in order to avoid later suspending or removing these measures.</p>
          <p id="p-2315" data-page="66972">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate the commenters&apos; concerns. Under sections 1833(i)(7)(B) and (t)(17)(C)(i) of the Act, except as the Secretary may otherwise provide, the Secretary must develop measures that reflect consensus among affected parties and, to the extent feasible and practicable, must include measures set forth by a national consensus building entity. Whenever possible, we strive to adopt NQF-endorsed measures because these measures will meet these requirements. However, we believe the requirements that measures reflect consensus among affected parties can be achieved in other ways, including through the measure development process, through broad acceptance and use of the measure, and through public comments.</p>
          <p id="p-2316" data-page="66972">Further, it may not be feasible or practicable to adopt an NQF-endorsed measure, such as when an NQF-endorsed measure does not exist. Section 1833(t)(17)(C)(i) of the Act does not require that each measure we adopt for the ASCQR Program be endorsed by a national consensus building entity, or by the NQF specifically. Moreover, section 1833(i)(7)(B) of the Act states that section 1833(t)(17) of the Act, which contains this requirement, applies to the ASCQR Program, except as the Secretary may otherwise provide. Under this provision, the Secretary has further authority to adopt measures that do not reflect consensus among affected parties and that are not endorsed by a national consensus building entity. Therefore, not all of the measures adopted for the ASCQR Program are required to be NQF-endorsed.</p>
          <p id="p-2317" data-page="66972">As discussed below, we believe the measure as developed exhibits sufficient levels of reliability, validity, and feasibility to be adopted for the ASCQR Program. As noted above, we also have submitted this measure to NQF for endorsement.</p>
          <p id="p-2318" data-page="66972">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters did not support CMS&apos; proposal to finalize ASC-12 because complications from colonoscopies are very rare and ASCs already take steps to ensure colonoscopies are conducted to eliminate preventable complications. Many commenters noted that the literature on the measure indicates the incidence of complications following colonoscopy is less than 2 percent. These commenters suggested that this low incidence meant that the measure should not be included in the ASCQR Program as it may be topped out or that the quality concern addressed by the measure does not rise to the level of importance needed for a national quality measurement program.</p>
          <p id="p-2319" data-page="66972">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Given the widespread use of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening in the outpatient setting, we consider colonoscopy a high volume procedure and measuring the quality of care associated with colonoscopies a high priority for us. We commend ASCs that are already taking steps to ensure colonoscopies are conducted to eliminate preventable complications. While we agree that the incidence of colonoscopy complications is relatively low, serious adverse events, such as perforation of the bowel and bleeding, may occur following colonoscopies. We view this measure as a critical outcome measure where the goal is to drive toward and sustain zero harm.</p>

          <p id="p-2320" data-page="66972">In addition, some literature suggests that many facilities performing colonoscopies are unaware of patients accessing hospital-based care with adverse events because patients return to different facilities, including hospitals and emergency departments, and would not return to the ASC<span id="page-66973" class="printed_page" data-page="66973"> </span>facility. For example, one study showed that physicians were unaware of nearly 75 percent of hospital admissions for adverse events following colonoscopy.<sup><a id="citation-37" name="#footnote-37" rel="footnote">
            [37]
          </a></sup>
            While most colonoscopies are performed without subsequent complication, we note that, in our analysis of Medicare FFS data, this measure showed that among Medicare patients aged &#x2265;65, 1.6 percent of outpatient colonoscopies resulted in an unplanned hospital visit within 7 days.<sup><a id="citation-38" name="#footnote-38" rel="footnote">
            [38]
          </a></sup>
            This estimate is based on a 20 percent sample of nationwide Medicare fee-for-service patients. If we were to use full national data (that is, a 100 percent sample), we estimate 1.7 million colonoscopies would have been performed among Medicare FFS patients and nearly 27,000 unplanned hospitals visits would have occurred within 7-days of the procedure. These findings suggest adverse events are not as rare or inconsequential as many believed and that quality measurement for colonoscopy procedures in the outpatient setting is important.</p>
          
          
          <p id="p-2323" data-page="66973">We agree with the commenters&apos; statement that the low incidence rate may suggest that the measure is topped-out, but in addition to the reasons for adopting this measure discussed above, we believe that a low incidence rate does not conclusively determine whether a measure has reached topped-out status. After the measure has been implemented, over time, we will assess it again for topped-out status using the two topped-out criteria we are finalizing in section XIV.B.3. of this final rule with comment period.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters expressed concern that ASC-12 is not sufficiently reliable to be included in the ASCQR Program, specifically, that the measure developer has indicated that the measure is only &#x201C;fairly&#x201D; reliable, with an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.335. These commenters contended that &#x201C;fair&#x201D; reliability is not sufficient for publicly reported quality metrics because such information could misinform the public, and urged CMS to conduct an analysis on the measure&apos;s reliability to understand the amount of data required to achieve &#x201C;good&#x201D; reliability. Several commenters argued that &#x201C;good&#x201D; reliability should result in an ICC of at least 0.60. Other commenters believed that reliability will improve with several years&apos; worth of data. Another commenter requested that data from this measure be withheld from public reporting until concerns about its reliability and validity can be thoroughly assessed.</p>
          <p id="p-2325" data-page="66973">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We disagree with commenters and believe that ASC-12 is sufficiently reliable to be included in the ASCQR Program. The ICC value submitted in the initial NQF application (0.335) was calculated using a split sample of data from 2 years. We randomly split the patient cohort at each hospital into two equal halves, calculated the measure using each half, and then calculated the agreement between these two (the `test&apos; and the `retest&apos;). After submitting the measure to NQF for endorsement review, we conducted additional calculations of the reliability testing score, this time using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula. The Spearman-Brown prophecy formula is an accepted statistical method which estimates the ICC if the sample were increased. Therefore, it allows us to estimate what the reliability score would be if all observations were used for public reporting rather than using a split sample. Our Spearman-Brown prophecy formula calculations resulted in a higher ICC of 0.43.</p>
          <p id="p-2326" data-page="66973">The NQF considers the ICC values ranging from 0.21 to 0.40 as &#x201C;fair&#x201D; reliability and values ranging from 0.41 to 0.60 as &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; reliability. Therefore, the ICC values of 0.335 and 0.43 are interpreted as &#x201C;fair&#x201D; and &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; reliability, respectively. These ICC values are also in line with other NQF-endorsed outcome measures used in other CMS programs. For example, in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (<a href="/citation/76-FR-51667">76 FR 51667</a>), the Inpatient Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30-day Risk Standardized Readmission measure (NQF #0505) has an ICC of 0.369 and the Pneumonia (PN) 30-day Risk Standardized Readmission measure (NQF #0506) has an ICC of 0.406. Both measures are NQF-endorsed. We consider the reliability of 0.335, as noted in the proposed rule, acceptable for the ASCQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2327" data-page="66973">Regarding the concerns that we should withhold public reporting until the measure&apos;s reliability and validity is addressed, as stated above, we believe the reliability of the measure is sufficiently reliable for inclusion in the ASCQR Program and do not agree that the public may be misinformed or that we should withhold public reporting. In addition to our calculations above, reliability testing previously conducted by the measure steward demonstrated the measure data elements produced were repeatable; that is, the same results were produced a high proportion of the time when assessed in the same population in the same time period. Also, validity testing by the measure steward demonstrated that the measure data elements produce measure scores that correctly reflect the quality of care provided and that adequately identify differences in quality.</p>
          <p id="p-2328" data-page="66973">As the commenters suggested, the measure reliability may be further improved by using several years&apos; worth of data; however, we must balance the reliability of the measure with the timeliness of the measure. As discussed, at this time, we believe that 1 year of data appropriately balances these competing interests for payment determination purposes, but we will continue to assess this belief during the dry run we discuss below. Also, we will consider conducting additional reliability assessments of the measure using an extended data period.</p>
          <p id="p-2329" data-page="66973">Moreover, we believe it is important to include this measure in the program because colonoscopy is a high volume, common procedure performed at outpatient facilities and is frequently performed on relatively healthy patients to screen for colorectal cancer. Given the widespread use of colonoscopy, understanding and minimizing procedure-related adverse events is a high priority. These adverse events, such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and intestinal perforation, can result in unanticipated hospital visits post procedure. Physicians performing colonoscopies are often unaware that patients seek acute care at hospitals following the procedure and the associated adverse events are potentially preventable. We strongly believe that the measure would promote improvement in patient care over time because transparency in publicly reporting measure scores would make patient unplanned hospital visits (emergency department visits, observation stays, and inpatient admissions) following colonoscopies more visible to ASCs and patients and incentivize ASCs to incorporate quality improvement activities in order to reduce these visits.</p>

          <p id="p-2330" data-page="66973">Finally, we believe this measure should be included in the program because currently this risk-standardized quality measure is the only measure available that would address this information gap and promote quality improvement by providing feedback to facilities and physicians, as well as transparency for patients on the rates<span id="page-66974" class="printed_page" data-page="66974"> </span>and variation across facilities in unplanned hospital visits after colonoscopy. There are no publicly available quality of care reports for ASCs that conduct outpatient colonoscopies. Therefore, adoption of this measure provides an opportunity to enhance the information available to patients choosing among ASCs that offer this elective procedure. We believe this measure would reduce adverse patient outcomes associated with preparation for colonoscopy, the procedure itself, and follow-up care by capturing and making more visible to ASCs and patients all unplanned hospital visits following the procedure. In addition, providing outcome rates to ASCs would make visible to clinicians meaningful quality differences and incentivize improvement.</p>

          <p id="p-2331" data-page="66974">In response to comments, however, to allow sufficient time to conduct further analysis of this measure, we are finalizing the adoption of this measure beginning with the CY 2018 payment determination, rather than beginning with the CY 2017 payment determination as proposed. We plan to perform a dry run of the measure in 2015. From our perspective, a dry run is a preliminary analysis of data in which ASCs may review their measure results, and ask questions about and become familiar with the measure methodology. Dry runs will include three to four years of paid Medicare FFS claims. We will use the most recent complete claims samples (usually 6 to 9 months prior to the start date) for dry runs. For example, if the dry run begins in March 2015, the most recent data available may be July 2011 to June 2014 (assuming 3 years of data). Because we use paid Medicare FFS claims, ASCs will not need to submit any data for the dry run. The general information on the dry run as well as the confidential dry run reports will be available for ASCs to review on their accounts at <i class="E-03"><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org" class="external wrap">https://www.qualitynet.org</a></i>. The dry run will generate confidential reports at the patient level, indicating whether the patient had a hospital visit, the type of visit (admission, emergency department visit, or observational stay), the admitting facility, and the principal discharge diagnosis. Further, the dry run will enable ASCs to see the measure score reports and have the opportunity to receive individual patient data and information contained within individual patient records. ASCs can use the information to identify performance gaps and develop quality improvement strategies. Dry run results are not linked to public reporting or payment determinations. We expect the dry run to take approximately 1 month to conduct once data are obtained, after which facilities will be provided the confidential report and the opportunity to review their performance and provide feedback to us.</p>
          <p id="p-2332" data-page="66974">In addition, we will continue to generate these reports for ASCs after we implement the measure beginning with the CY 2018 payment determination. The measure will have no payment impact until the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years. Public display of measure data will occur on or after December 1, 2017, but there will be no public display of the dry run data.</p>
          <p id="p-2333" data-page="66974">With national implementation of a dry run of this measure, we also will review the appropriate cutoff volume for facilities, if necessary, in reporting the measure score. We require a minimum volume (cutoff volume) of colonoscopies per facility to be able to calculate a reliable measure score. We have yet to determine the minimum volume per facility (that is, the cutoff colonoscopy volume). Because we used a Medicare 20-percent sample to develop the measure, we could not estimate this cutoff during measure development. However, testing during the measure dry-run with 100 percent of the sample per facility will help us to determine the appropriate cutoff volume of colonoscopies per facility. ASCs will be notified via the QualityNet Web site of the cutoff volume of colonoscopies per facility, if any.</p>

          <p id="p-2334" data-page="66974">While some ASCs perform too few colonoscopies for us to calculate a measure score and we would not publicly report their data, these facilities would remain in the measure cohort. Typically, for public reporting of hospital measures on the CMS Web site <i class="E-03">Hospital Compare,</i> the measure score is reported as &#x201C;Number of cases too small&#x201D; for hospitals with fewer cases than the cutoff. We will use the same protocol when the measure is publicly reported for the ASCQR Program, and will report a measure score as &#x201C;Number of cases too small&#x201D; for ASCs with fewer cases than the cutoff on the QualityNet Web site.</p>
          <p id="p-2335" data-page="66974">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters pointed out that, from the perspective of using claims as a data source for this measure, the codes for ASCs are services rendered-driven, while the codes for HOPDs are diagnosis-driven. Commenters were concerned that the coded information and the associated risk-adjustment for this measure may not be able to capture the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical care following an outpatient colonoscopy. Given the difference in coding practices and claims architecture between HOPDs and ASCs, commenters recommended further testing for a fair performance comparison between HOPDs and ASCs. One commenter inquired if CMS plans to field test this measure prior to implementation. Commenters contended that the measure must be systematically assessed to assure the measure results are attributable to differences in quality alone. The commenters suggested that the measure score should be directly validated against outpatient medical records and measure results across settings must be assessed to ensure that any comparisons are valid.</p>
          <p id="p-2336" data-page="66974">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for expressing their concerns regarding possible effects of coding practices and claims architecture on the data available through administrative claims in capturing the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical care following an outpatient colonoscopy. The measure is designed, however, to mitigate any differences in coding practices across HOPDs and ASCs. For example, to capture comorbidities for risk adjustment, the measure uses claims across care settings, including physician outpatient claims, so differences in claims submitted during the procedure are not likely to affect the comorbidities assigned to the patient. In addition, the outcome counts hospital visits regardless of whether they are billed as admissions, emergency room visits, or observations stays; therefore, if there are differences between colonoscopies done at ASCs and HOPDs in the type of hospital visit a patient with complications incurs (for example, whether observation stays or ED visits are used), the measure will be insensitive to these differences.</p>

          <p id="p-2337" data-page="66974">We recognize that the claims architecture differs for HOPDs and ASCs because the two facility types utilize different bill forms and have different payment systems. However, we do not agree that our measure specifications do not account for differences in claims architecture and necessary billing codes in discerning hospital events following colonoscopy. The measure includes colonoscopies from all outpatient settings to ensure that the expected hospital visit rate for any facility is estimated using the full national experience of colonoscopy patients. Specifically, we include all outpatient colonoscopies to make sure that: (1) The effects that risk factors exert on the outcome are estimated based on colonoscopies performed among all outpatient settings; and (2) the national average rate of hospital visits following colonoscopy is calculated based on all outpatient colonoscopies. Our approach<span id="page-66975" class="printed_page" data-page="66975"> </span>includes all outpatient claims, including HOPD, ASC, and physician claims. To identify all outpatient colonoscopy claims, including claims affected by the Medicare 3-day payment window policy, the measure specifications link claims across multiple care settings (outpatient and inpatient). Furthermore, the measure specifications link claims across multiple care settings to derive comorbidity data to ensure the patient comorbidities are captured to the fullest extent possible for risk-adjustment and to identify patient outcomes.</p>
          <p id="p-2338" data-page="66975">Linking patient claims across multiple settings largely mitigates the impact of potential difference in coding practice among settings and allows comparisons of colonoscopy quality across settings. For example, potential variation in the coding of comorbidities in the index colonoscopy claim may occur based on the setting. However, we derive comorbidities for risk adjustment from all inpatient and outpatient claims in the preceding 12 months. By using all claims in the preceding year, we capture patient comorbidities to the fullest extent possible and mitigate the impact of potential coding differences between settings that would occur if we used the index colonoscopy claim alone.</p>
          <p id="p-2339" data-page="66975">Further, similar approaches to deriving comorbidities from claims data are used for other risk-adjusted outcome measures. The measure developer has validated the accuracy of this approach on multiple occasions for prior measures developed for the inpatient setting. For example, in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (<a href="/citation/76-FR-51667">76 FR 51667</a>), the Inpatient Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30-day Risk Standardized Readmission measure (NQF #0505) has an ICC of 0.369, and the Pneumonia (PN) 30-day Risk Standardized Readmission measure (NQF #0506) has an ICC of 0.406. Both measures are NQF-endorsed.</p>
          <p id="p-2340" data-page="66975">Regarding the suggestion that the measure score should be directly validated against outpatient medical records, at this time, we believe that it would be overly burdensome to validate the reported data, because of the limited experience that ASCs have with reporting quality data to CMS coupled with the low incidence of cases for this measure. In addition, as stated in section XIV.D.6. of this final rule with comment period, we refer readers to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/77-FR-53641">77 FR 53641</a> through 53642) for a complete discussion of our policy not to require validation of claims-based measures (beyond the usual claims validation activities conducted by our Medicare Administrative Contractors).</p>
          <p id="p-2341" data-page="66975">We appreciate commenters&apos; concerns regarding factors that may impact HOPDs and ASCs. In response to comments, to allow sufficient time to conduct further analysis of this measure, we are finalizing the adoption of this measure beginning with the CY 2018 payment determination, rather than beginning with the CY 2017 payment determination as proposed.</p>
          <p id="p-2342" data-page="66975">In addition, we plan to perform a dry run (a preliminary analysis) of the measure in 2015. We refer readers to our discussion of the dry run above, in response to a previous comment.</p>
          <p id="p-2343" data-page="66975">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters disagreed with the statement in the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41047">79 FR 41047</a>) that the ASC-12 measure is &#x201C;well-defined and precisely specified for consistent implementation within and between organizations that will allow for comparability.&#x201D; These commenters raised the issue that the Medicare payment window policy that applies to hospitals will result in under-detection of hospital events for colonoscopies performed by HOPDs; the 3-day (or 1-day) payment window applies to outpatient services furnished by hospitals and hospitals that are wholly owned or wholly operated Part B entities. Hospitals are required to bundle the technical component of all outpatient diagnostic services and related nondiagnostic services (for example, therapeutic) with the claim for an inpatient stay when services are furnished to a Medicare beneficiary in the 3 days (or, in the case of a hospital that is not a subsection (d) hospital, during the 1-day) preceding an inpatient admission in compliance with section 1886 of the Act. Commenters expressed their concern that as a result of this payment policy, HOPDs may have systematic undercounting of hospital visits while ASCs get a full count of all hospital visits within 7 days subsequent to outpatient colonoscopy. Commenters did not believe the methodological solution proposed by the measure developer, using physician claims with an HOPD Place of Service (POS) code indicating the colonoscopy was performed at an HOPD, is adequate due to the high error rates in POS coding on physician claims. Commenters were concerned that these challenges would make comparison of HOPD and ASC data impossible, and significantly reduce the validity of the measure in the HOPD setting.</p>
          <p id="p-2344" data-page="66975">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We disagree with the commenters, and we continue to believe this measure is &#x201C;well-defined and precisely specified for consistent implementation within and between organizations that will allow for comparability,&#x201D; as we stated in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41047">79 FR 41047</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-2345" data-page="66975">We agree that the ability to detect meaningful variation is an important indication of the value of a measure. As the commenter has correctly noted, we have shown facility variation in unplanned hospital visits following colonoscopy in both nationwide Medicare data from HOPDs and also in the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data. We have also shown facility variation in unplanned hospital visits among ASCs alone using HCUP data from California.<sup><a id="citation-39" name="#footnote-39" rel="footnote">
            [39]
          </a></sup>
            The observed average hospital visit rate and the variation in unplanned hospital visit rates among ASCs, which are unaffected by the 3-day payment window policy, were very similar to HOPDs suggesting that the measure performs equally well in both settings. Accordingly, we are confident that the variation shown is a reflection of facility variation in quality and not as a result of any issues to do with the 3-day payment window policy.</p>
          
          <p id="p-2347" data-page="66975">Based on our internal testing with claims data, we believe our current algorithm is appropriate and accurate. However, since we always strive for improvement, we will evaluate the colonoscopy measure dry run data and work with HOPDs and ASCs to further review and refine the algorithm if necessary.</p>
          <p id="p-2348" data-page="66975">Regarding POS billing, the OIG has found billing errors incorrectly assigning the service site for both HOPDs and ASC-related claims on physician claims where there were matching HOPD or ASC claims and that the percentage of incorrectly billed claims was significantly higher for ASC-related claims.<sup><a id="citation-40" name="#footnote-40" rel="footnote">

            Many physicians&apos; services can be furnished either in a facility setting such as an HOPD or ASC, or in a non-facility setting such as a physician&apos;s office, urgent care center or independent clinic. For these services, Medicare has two different payment rates under the physician fee schedule (PFS). The PFS facility rate is generally lower to reflect the fact that certain resources are supplied by the facility, and Medicare makes a separate payment to the facility under another payment system. By matching both facility and physician colonoscopy claims for any given patient, the current measure methodology ensures that colonoscopy claims are identified to the fullest extent<span id="page-66976" class="printed_page" data-page="66976"> </span>possible and attribute the colonoscopy to the appropriate provider when billing is affected by the 3-day window payment policy.</p>
          
          <p id="p-2350" data-page="66976">We clarify that HOPD claims for colonoscopy procedures for calculation of the measure are identified using both physician and facility claims. We did not intend to imply that HOPD colonoscopy claims are identified solely from physician claims. For both ASCs and HOPDs, the measure first identifies colonoscopy claims using both the physician claim and the corresponding facility claim to ensure the site of the colonoscopy service is attributed to the appropriate provider. As a second step, the measure matches: (1) Physician claims that contain HOPD as the POS that do not have a matching facility claim with (2) inpatient claims to identify potential HOPD colonoscopies resulting in an inpatient admission. This second additional step identifies HOPD colonoscopy claims affected by the 3-day window payment policy.</p>
          <p id="p-2351" data-page="66976">Therefore, we do not agree that ASCs will be adversely affected by use of POS billing to locate colonoscopies performed by physicians due to high levels of coding errors in POS coding on Part B for physician services because our measure calculation methodology addresses this concern.</p>

          <p id="p-2352" data-page="66976">We also have taken steps to educate physicians about the appropriate POS coding and actively audit physicians to improve the accuracy of POS coding <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/MM7502.pdf" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/MM7502.pdf</a></i>.

These commenters gave examples of the alleged inappropriate inpatient elements: (1) Certain condition categories (CCs) are not included in risk adjustment if they are only recorded at the time of the colonoscopy, and yet they are considered to be possible adverse outcomes; and (2) although end stage renal disease (ESRD) would not be a complication of colonoscopy diagnosed and recorded at the time of the procedure, it was included on the list of CCs.

In view of the comments, we have revised the list of CCs and updated the measure specifications to ensure only conditions relevant to colonoscopy are included. Of note, the inclusion of ESRD on the list was an error; we have revised the list and will use the revised list in implementing the measure.

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We clarify that this measure is purposely designed to use a broad outcome of hospital visits following surgery rather than a narrow set of easily identifiable complications. From a patient and health system perspective, the goal of this measure is to encourage and inform ASC efforts to minimize all potential acute complications, not just those narrowly related to procedural technique. This is important as the literature suggests, <sup class="E-51">41, 42, 43, 44</sup>
            that hospital visits following colonoscopy occur due to a range of adverse events relating to the bowel preparation, anesthesia, the colonoscopy procedure itself, and follow-up care. These include a range of symptoms and signs such as abdominal pain, bloating, dizziness and collapse, electrolyte disturbances, and cardiorespiratory symptoms (from sedation use), in addition to complications that are directly related to procedural technique such as bleeding and bowel perforation.

          <p id="p-2369" data-page="66977">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The measure score is the ratio of predicted hospital visits (numerator) over the expected hospital visits (denominator) multiplied by the crude national rate. The measure score numerator is the predicted rate, which is the number of unplanned hospital visits the facility is predicted to have within 7 days of colonoscopy, and it accounts for the observed unplanned hospital visit rate, the number of colonoscopies performed at the facility, and the facility&apos;s case mix. This is sometimes referred to as the &#x201C;adjusted actual rate.&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="p-2370" data-page="66977">The measure score denominator is the expected rate, which is the number of unplanned hospital visits the facility is expected to have, based on the nation&apos;s performance with that facility&apos;s case-mix. It is the sum of all patients&apos; expected probabilities of a hospital visit, given their risk factors and the risk of readmission at an average hospital. The contribution of each risk factor (for example, age) to the patient&apos;s risk of a hospital admission is based on all of the patients in the measure cohort. The crude national rate is the average rate of hospital visits following colonoscopy observed in the entire measure cohort. We also refer readers to the measure discussion above and measure specifications (<i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.qualityforum.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=75057" class="external wrap">http://www.qualityforum.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;amp;ItemID=75057</a></i>) for a more detailed discussion of how the numerator and denominator are calculated.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters were concerned that facilities would lack actionable information generated from ASC-12. Several of these commenters questioned whether this measure will benefit facilities and patients because each facility will only receive a report with an aggregate number of claims that will be based on historical data, which will make it difficult for the facility to set a course for improvement if needed. Commenters requested that CMS clarify its plan to report detailed patient-level data confidentially to ASCs that indicates whether the patient had a hospital visit, the type of visit (admission, emergency department visit, or observational stay), the admitting facility, and the principal discharge diagnosis to assist facilities with quality improvement, to enable facilities to understand their performance and take steps where remediation is needed. Several commenters also noted that ASCs do not provide post-operative follow-up care after patient discharges and do not have direct access to the records of other health care facilities. Consequently, this constraint would limit their ability to identify improvements based on the data provided by this measure.</p>
          <p id="p-2372" data-page="66977">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The primary purpose of this measure is to illuminate the quality differences in colonoscopies that are presently not visible to patients and may not be visible to some facilities. In measure development, we found the facility variations in the measure score suggest some facilities provide worse than expected care. We believe the detailed patient-level data that we will provide confidentially to ASCs will help them identify areas for improvement efforts. The data would indicate whether the patient had a hospital visit, the type of visit (admission, emergency department visit, or observational stay), the admitting facility, and the principal discharge diagnosis. The dry run will enable ASCs to see the measure score reports and have the opportunity to receive individual patient data and information contained within individual patient records. We will continue to generate these reports for ASCs after we implement the measure beginning with the CY 2018 payment determination. ASCs can use the information to identify performance gaps and develop quality improvement strategies.</p>
          <p id="p-2373" data-page="66977">We understand the challenges involved in following up with ASC patients. The colonoscopy measure addresses these challenges by providing feedback to facilities and clinicians about the outcomes experienced by their patients following colonoscopy. Many clinical experts noted that facilities were often unaware of patients&apos; return visits to hospitals. They noted that many patients would often return to a different facility or an emergency department. One study noted that physicians were unaware of 75 percent of return hospital visits following colonoscopy at a major tertiary center.<sup><a id="citation-47" name="#footnote-47" rel="footnote">

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters expressed concern that ASC-12 does not include risk-adjustment to account for patient differences, stating that CMS does not report the variation between ASCs once this risk adjustment has been applied and that there may be no statistically significant difference between an ASC&apos;s risk-adjusted visit rate and the national average making it impossible to identify low performers and high performers. One commenter specifically recommended that patients with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and diverticulitis should be included with appropriate risk adjustment. Commenters recommended CMS consider the drawbacks of the current methodology, conduct analysis to test the variation of the measure between ASCs, and reconsider this measure for inclusion in future proposals.</p>
          <p id="p-2376" data-page="66977">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for all the suggestions to improve the measure. In the measure application for NQF endorsement, we note that the measure, following risk-adjustment, is able to detect statistically significant variation between outpatient facilities by demonstrating measure score variation using the 2010 HCUP data from four States (California, New York, Nebraska, and Florida). Using a very conservative sampling technique (sampling with replacement),<sup><a id="citation-48" name="#footnote-48" rel="footnote">
            [48]
          </a></sup>

            we constructed 95 percent interval estimates around the facility measure score (similar to confidence intervals) and used the estimates to place facilities into three performance categories: Worse than expected; no different than expected; and better than expected. Based on this analysis, we identified 5 outlier facilities among a total of 992<span id="page-66978" class="printed_page" data-page="66978"> </span>ASCs and HOPDs. This analysis included only about one-tenth of all outpatient facilities in the United States. Typically, we see greater variation between facilities when 100 percent of nationwide facilities are included for actual measure implementation and reporting.</p>
          
          <p id="p-2378" data-page="66978">As to the commenter&apos;s recommendation to risk-adjust patients with certain conditions, we excluded patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and diverticulitis because it is difficult to assess from claims data whether these patients have an active or inactive disease which may alter their risk of the outcome. We determined that we could not adequately risk-adjust for the risk of the outcome for these patients. Second, our analysis suggested that nearly half of the patients with IBD and diverticulitis have post-colonoscopy hospital visits with a primary diagnosis of IBD and diverticulitis respectively. We could not tell from the claims data whether these visits were planned or unplanned. We did test for variation among ASCs and HOPDs independently using HCUP data from California (see Measure Technical Report). As we previously discussed, the measure was able to adequately detect variation in the measure score among ASCs.</p>
          <p id="p-2379" data-page="66978">As for the inquiry about further testing the measure, we have more time to further test the measure because, in response to comments, we are finalizing the adoption of this measure beginning with the CY 2018 payment determination, rather than beginning with the CY 2017 payment determination as proposed. We plan to perform a dry run (a preliminary analysis) of the measure in 2015. We refer readers to our discussion of the dry run above, in response to a previous comment.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenter for providing this input and note that this measure will be calculated completely from data obtained from paid Medicare FFS claims submitted by ASCs, hospitals, and physicians. For this reason, it will not require any additional information-gathering on the part of ASCs.</p>
          <p id="p-2382" data-page="66978">We continue to believe that quality of care measurement in the clinical area of outpatient colonoscopy is an important gap area with ample room for improvement and that this measure has sufficient reliability and validity for use in the ASCQR Program. Therefore, after consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing our proposal to adopt the ASC-12: Facility Seven-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy measure for the ASCQR Program. However, to allow ASCs sufficient time to review their measure data from the dry run and utilize the confidential facility reports with patient-level associated hospital event information, we are finalizing the adoption of this measure for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years, instead of the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years as proposed.</p>
          <p id="p-2383" data-page="66978">We plan to perform a dry run (a preliminary analysis) of the measure in 2015.

We refer readers to our discussion of the dry run and the cutoff volume above, in our response to a previous comment.</p>

          <p id="p-2386" data-page="66979">We refer readers to the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68493">77 FR 68493</a> through 68494), where we finalized our approach to future measure selection for the ASCQR Program. We seek to develop a comprehensive set of quality measures to be available for widespread use for informed &#x201C;patient decision-making and quality improvement in the ASC setting&#x201D; (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68496">77 FR 68496</a>). We also seek to align these quality measures with the National Quality Strategy (NQS), the CMS Strategic Plan (which includes the CMS Quality Strategy), and our other quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs, as appropriate. Accordingly, as we stated in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41048">79 FR 41048</a> through 41049), in considering future ASCQR Program measures, we are focusing on the following NQS and CMS Quality Strategy measure domains: Make care safer; strengthen person and family engagement; promote effective communication and coordination of care; promote effective prevention and treatment; work with communities to promote best practices of healthy living; and make care affordable.</p>
          <p id="p-2387" data-page="66979">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Commenters supported CMS&apos; alignment efforts. One commenter supported the direction of the ASCQR Program to align future measures with the NQS priorities, noting that doing so will make the ASCQR Program more consistent with the Hospital IQR Program. Another commenter agreed with the goal of aligning measures in the ASCQR Program with the Hospital OQR Program and the Hospital IQR Program, and urged that the alignment should eliminate confusion and avoid disadvantaging ASCs.</p>
          <p id="p-2388" data-page="66979">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for supporting our alignment efforts. To the extent practicable, we strive to align measures with national priorities, including the NQS priorities as well as across our quality reporting and value-based purchasing programs.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters requested that CMS collaborate with stakeholder communities to develop and implement appropriate ophthalmic measures for the ASC setting, potentially including measures of incidence of toxic anterior segment syndrome in cataract surgery patients, incorrect intraocular lens implantation in cataract surgery patients, and unplanned anterior vitrectomy in cataract surgery patients. Another commenter suggested that CMS consider several new measures in the future, including adverse outcomes from high-volume procedures such as cataract removals, other eye procedures, endoscopies, musculoskeletal procedures, and colonoscopies. This commenter also encouraged CMS to develop composite measures of common surgical infections and to involve consumers and purchasers in refinement of the CAHPS survey for the outpatient setting. In addition, this commenter urged CMS to continue to analyze and address the role of the survey and discuss the comparative roles of PQRS CAHPS, ACO CAHPS, S-CAHPS, or the HOSD/ASC CAHPS surveys.</p>
          <p id="p-2390" data-page="66979">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for these recommendations and will consider these types of measures in future years. We have included an unplanned anterior vitrectomy in cataract surgery patients and patient experience of care survey measures in our Measures under Consideration (MUC) list for the MAP for the ASC setting. We agree that the adoption and implementation of appropriate cataract surgery measures are important for the ASCQR Program, given the number of such procedures performed on Medicare beneficiaries in this setting.</p>
          <p id="p-2391" data-page="66979">We use patient experience of care surveys in a variety of health care settings. We agree that, to the extent feasible, survey instruments should be aligned and coordinated across settings. The developmental process of CAHPS and patient experience of care surveys involves several opportunities for input from patients, patient advocates, and stakeholders from the HOPD and ASC industry, including professional associations, clinicians, accreditation organizations, and the government.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We generally request comments on future ASCQR Program measure topics through the rulemaking process and did so in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-43664">78 FR 43664</a>). We also accepted measures for consideration from associations through ONC&apos;s measure project tracking system (<i class="E-03"><a href="http://oncprojectracking.org/" class="external wrap">http://oncprojectracking.org/</a></i>); associations were invited via the CMS Listserv to attend a training session for how to submit measures into this system. Regarding distinguishing ASCs by the services provided, we are aware that ASCs vary in the types of services they provide. This variety presents challenges in devising a measure set that can glean applicable quality of care information across ASCs. With respect to current claims-based measures that include surgical procedures, at this time, we are not able to identify facilities that would never perform surgical procedures from the<span id="page-66980" class="printed_page" data-page="66980"> </span>information on claims.

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter noted that the program currently includes a measure on hospital transfer or admission after a procedure, which tracks whether patients are transferred or admitted directly to a hospital (including a hospital emergency room) upon discharge from an ASC. This commenter believed that this measure could be expanded to include patients who return home after the ASC procedure, but are admitted to a hospital shortly thereafter because of a problem related to the procedure because doing so would enable us to more comprehensively track patients who experience serious complications or medical errors related to an ASC procedure.</p>
          <p id="p-2397" data-page="66980">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenter for providing this information and note that the ASC-12: Facility Seven-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy measure includes all unplanned hospital visits (emergency department visits, observation stays and inpatient admissions) within 7 days following the procedure.

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenter for the comment and note that we seek to provide information to ASC facilities in advance whenever possible to support future planning. For example, in the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC rulemaking, we finalized measures sets for the CY 2014, CY 2015, and CY 2016 payment determinations (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74496">76 FR 74496</a> to 74511). Similarly, in the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we finalized a data collection and processing period policy for claims-based measures using QDCs for the CY 2015 payment determination and subsequent years (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68497">77 FR 68497</a> through 68498), and in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we finalized our policy regarding participation status for the CY 2016 payment determination and subsequent years (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75134">78 FR 75134</a> through 75135). In this year&apos;s rulemaking, we also are finalizing policies that span more than one year, such as including the ASC-12 measure in the ASCQR Program measure set for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years, the process for removing measures, and topped-out criteria. While we cannot commit to providing a 2-year or 3-year timeline at this point due to the rapidly evolving quality measurement and program environment, we will continue to provide information to ASCs through the QualityNet Web site, the ASCQR Program ListServe, and the rulemaking process as appropriate.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters expressed concern about the MAP, specifically the public comment process and the practice of submitting measure concepts for consideration. These commenters believed that the MAP does not adequately consider public comments, and stated that the MAP session agendas scheduled voting activities prior to public comments, which limited the ability of comments to impact voting, and that the public could not address the Coordinating Committee until after deliberations were completed. These commenters also stated that the public could comment on the draft MAP Pre-Rulemaking Report, but that these comments were not considered by the Coordinating Committee and, therefore, did not result in revisions to the final report. These commenters recommended that public comments be solicited prior to, rather than, after voting on agenda items, and that the MAP Coordinating Committee be required to formally consider and respond to public comments on the draft report. Several other commenters expressed concern regarding the MAP&apos;s review of measure &#x201C;concepts&#x201D; that have not been fully developed, saying that recommendations are premature for measure concepts or measure drafts. These commenters recommended that when &#x201C;concepts&#x201D; are presented, the MAP should determine whether the measure concept/draft would fill a measure gap but reserve further judgment for the completed measure. These commenters are further concerned that the inclusion of measure &#x201C;concepts&#x201D; results in an unreasonably large number of items for the MAP to consider, which can limit the time allotted to consider each measure.</p>

In the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68496">77 FR 68496</a> through 68497) and the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75131">78 FR 75131</a>), we provided additional clarification regarding the ASCQR Program policy in the context of the previously finalized Hospital OQR Program policy, including the processes for addressing nonsubstantive and substantive changes to adopted measures.</p>

          <p id="p-2413" data-page="66981">We maintain technical specifications for previously adopted ASCQR Program measures. These specifications are updated as we continue to develop the ASCQR Program. The manuals that contain specifications for the previously adopted measures can be found on the QualityNet Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier2&amp;cid=1228772475754" class="external wrap">https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier2&amp;amp;cid=1228772475754</a></i>.</p>
          <p id="p-2414" data-page="66981">Many of the quality measures used in Medicare and Medicaid reporting programs are NQF-endorsed. We note that two of the measures previously adopted for the ASCQR Program are not NQF-endorsed, and NQF endorsement is not a program requirement. However, for those measures that are NQF-endorsed, the NQF requires measure stewards to submit annual measure maintenance updates and undergo maintenance of endorsement review every 3 years as part of its regular maintenance process for NQF-endorsed performance measures. In the measure maintenance process, the measure steward (owner/developer) is responsible for updating and maintaining the currency and relevance of the measure and will confirm existing or minor specification changes with the NQF on an annual basis. The NQF solicits information from measure stewards for annual reviews, and it reviews measures for continued endorsement in a specific 3-year cycle.</p>
          <p id="p-2415" data-page="66981">We note that the NQF&apos;s annual or triennial maintenance processes for endorsed measures may result in the NQF requiring updates to measures in order to maintain endorsement status. Other non-NQF measures may undergo maintenance changes as well. We believe that it is important to have in place the subregulatory process that we have adopted for the ASCQR Program to incorporate nonsubstantive updates into the measure specifications for measures so that the measure specifications remain current. We also recognize that some changes to measures are substantive in nature and might not be appropriate for adoption using a subregulatory process.</p>

<h4><a name="281"></a>C. Payment Reduction for ASCs That Fail To Meet the ASCQR Program Requirements</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Statutory Background</b></p>
          <p id="p-2420" data-page="66981">We refer readers to section XV.C.1. of the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75131">78 FR 75131</a> through 75132) for a detailed discussion of the statutory background regarding payment reductions for ASCs that fail to meet the ASCQR Program requirements.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Reduction to the ASC Payment Rates for ASCs That Fail To Meet the ASCQR Program Requirements for a Payment Determination Year</b></p>

          <p id="p-2421" data-page="66981">The national unadjusted payment rates for many services paid under the ASC payment system equal the product of the ASC conversion factor and the scaled relative payment weight for the APC to which the service is assigned. Currently, the ASC conversion factor is equal to the conversion factor calculated for the previous year updated by the MFP-adjusted CPI-U update factor, which is the adjustment set forth in section 1833(i)(2)(D)(v) of the Act. The MFP-adjusted CPI-U update factor is the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), which currently is the annual update for the ASC payment system, minus the MFP adjustment. As discussed in the CY 2011 MPFS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/75-FR-73397">75 FR 73397</a>), if the CPI-U is a negative number, the CPI-U would be held to zero. Under the ASCQR Program, any annual update will be reduced by 2.0 percentage points for ASCs that fail to meet the reporting requirements of the ASCQR Program. This reduction applied beginning with the CY 2014 payment rates. For a complete discussion of the calculation of the ASC conversion factor, we refer readers to section XII.G. of this final rule with comment period.<span id="page-66982" class="printed_page" data-page="66982"> </span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-2422" data-page="66982">In the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68499">77 FR 68499</a> through 68500), in order to implement the requirement to reduce the annual update for ASCs that fail to meet the ASCQR Program requirements, we finalized our proposal that we would calculate two conversion factors: A full update conversion factor and an ASCQR Program reduced update conversion factor. We finalized our proposal to calculate the reduced national unadjusted payment rates using the ASCQR Program reduced update conversion factor that would apply to ASCs that fail to meet their quality reporting requirements for that calendar year payment determination. We finalized our proposal that application of the 2.0 percentage point reduction to the annual update may result in the update to the ASC payment system being less than zero prior to the application of the MFP adjustment.</p>
          <p id="p-2423" data-page="66982">The ASC conversion factor is used to calculate the ASC payment rate for services with the following payment indicators (listed in Addenda AA and BB to this final rule with comment period, which are available via the Internet on the CMS Web site): &#x201C;A2,&#x201D; &#x201C;G2,&#x201D; &#x201C;P2,&#x201D; &#x201C;R2,&#x201D; &#x201C;Z2,&#x201D; as well as the service portion of device-intensive procedures identified by &#x201C;J8.&#x201D; We finalized our proposal that payment for all services assigned the payment indicators listed above would be subject to the reduction of the national unadjusted payment rates for applicable ASCs using the ASCQR Program reduced update conversion factor.</p>
          <p id="p-2424" data-page="66982">The conversion factor is not used to calculate the ASC payment rates for separately payable services that are assigned status indicators other than payment indicators &#x201C;A2,&#x201D; &#x201C;G2,&#x201D; &#x201C;J8,&#x201D; &#x201C;P2,&#x201D; &#x201C;R2,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Z2.&#x201D; These services include separately payable drugs and biologicals, pass-through devices that are contractor-priced, brachytherapy sources that are paid based on the OPPS payment rates, and certain office-based procedures and radiology services where payment is based on the MPFS PE RVU amount and a few other specific services that receive cost-based payment. As a result, we also finalized our proposal that the ASC payment rates for these services would not be reduced for failure to meet the ASCQR Program requirements because the payment rates for these services are not calculated using the ASC conversion factor and, therefore, not affected by reductions to the annual update.</p>
          <p id="p-2425" data-page="66982">Office-based surgical procedures (performed more than 50 percent of the time in physicians&apos; offices) and separately paid radiology services (excluding covered ancillary radiology services involving certain nuclear medicine procedures or involving the use of contrast agents, as discussed in section XII.C.1.b. of this final rule with comment period) are paid at the lesser of the MPFS nonfacility PE RVU-based amounts or the amount calculated under the standard ASC ratesetting methodology. Similarly, in section XII.D.2.b. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing that payment for the new category of covered ancillary services (that is, certain diagnostic test codes within the medical range of CPT codes for which separate payment is allowed under the OPPS and when they are integral to an ASC covered surgical procedure) will be at the lesser of the MPFS nonfacility PE RVU-based amounts or the rate calculated according to the standard ASC ratesetting methodology. In the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68500">77 FR 68500</a>), we finalized our proposal that the standard ASC ratesetting methodology for this type of comparison would use the ASC conversion factor that has been calculated using the full ASC update adjusted for productivity. This is necessary so that the resulting ASC payment indicator, based on the comparison, assigned to these procedures or services is consistent for each HCPCS code regardless of whether payment is based on the full update conversion factor or the reduced update conversion factor.</p>
          <p id="p-2426" data-page="66982">For ASCs that receive the reduced ASC payment for failure to meet the ASCQR Program requirements, we believe that it is both equitable and appropriate that a reduction in the payment for a service should result in proportionately reduced copayment liability for beneficiaries. Therefore, in the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68500">77 FR 68500</a>), we finalized our proposal that the Medicare beneficiary&apos;s national unadjusted copayment for a service to which a reduced national unadjusted payment rate applies would be based on the reduced national unadjusted payment rate.</p>
          <p id="p-2427" data-page="66982">In that final rule with comment period, we finalized our proposal that all other applicable adjustments to the ASC national unadjusted payment rates would apply in those cases when the annual update is reduced for ASCs that fail to meet the requirements of the ASCQR Program (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68500">77 FR 68500</a>). For example, the following standard adjustments would apply to the reduced national unadjusted payment rates: The wage index adjustment, the multiple procedure adjustment, the interrupted procedure adjustment, and the adjustment for devices furnished with full or partial credit or without cost. We believe that these adjustments continue to be equally applicable to payment for ASCs that do not meet the ASCQR Program requirements.</p>
          <p id="p-2428" data-page="66982">In the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75132">78 FR 75132</a>), we did not make any changes to these policies. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41049">79 FR 41049</a> through 41050), we did not propose any changes to these policies.</p>

<h4><a name="287"></a>E. Form, Manner, and Timing of Data Submitted for the ASCQR Program</h4>

          <p id="p-2434" data-page="66983">We received public comments on alternate methods for submitting data for the ASCQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2435" data-page="66983">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter recommended that CMS allow ASCs to meet the requirements of the ASCQR Program using registry-based reporting, noting that using a registry is an option under the PQRS and that other registries are already in existence. This commenter recommended CMS issue proposals regarding this option in next year&apos;s proposed rule. The commenter also recommended that ASCs should also have the option of submitting quality data to CMS through an EHR-based reporting mechanism, as there are ASCs that have implemented this technology and could benefit from this option.</p>
          <p id="p-2436" data-page="66983">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenter for these suggestions. We agree that it could reduce burden to have a registry-based mechanism for data submission. We have not proposed a registry-based reporting option because currently, there is not a registry in place that is collecting information on the quality measures that we have adopted for this program. Should registry-based reporting of the ASC quality measures adopted for the ASCQR Program become available in the future, we will explore further the viability of incorporating a registry-based reporting mechanism in the ASCQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2437" data-page="66983">Regarding the use of EHR systems for reporting quality data, we agree that reporting by this method could reduce reporting burden. However, we are not aware of quality measures for ASCs that have been specified for electronic reporting. If such measures do exist, an understanding of the level of EHR adoption and capabilities of ASCs to utilize this method would be necessary before proposing their adoption by the ASCQR Program. As we discussed in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75124">78 FR 75124</a> through 75126), in a recent environmental scan, which included an assessment of the readiness of ASC to electronically report quality data, we found evidence of low levels of EHR use by ASCs. We believe that ASCs continue to be slow to adopt EHRs because many of these facilities are small and the cost of EHRs may pose a barrier to adoption. Further, there has been no incentive program to encourage such adoption by ASCs.</p>

          <p id="p-2452" data-page="66984">We refer readers to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, where we adopted ASC-11: Cataracts&#x2014;Improvement in Patient&apos;s Visual Function within 90 Days Following Cataract Surgery (NQF #1536) beginning with the CY 2016 payment determination (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75129">78 FR 75129</a>), and finalized the data collection and data submission timelines (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75138">78 FR 75138</a> to 75139). This measure assesses the rate of patients 18 years and older (with a diagnosis of uncomplicated cataract) in a sample who had improvement in visual function achieved within 90 days following cataract surgery based on completing both a pre-operative and post-operative visual function survey.</p>
          <p id="p-2453" data-page="66984">Since our adoption of this measure, we have come to believe that it can be operationally difficult at this time for ASCs to collect and report this measure. Specifically, we are concerned that the results of the survey used to assess the pre-operative and post-operative visual function of the patient may not be shared across clinicians and facilities, making it difficult for ASCs to have knowledge of the visual function of the patient before and after surgery. We are also concerned about the surveys used to assess visual function; the measure allows for the use of any validated survey and results may be inconsistent should clinicians use different surveys.</p>

          <p id="p-2454" data-page="66984">Therefore, on December 31, 2013, we issued guidance stating that we would delay data collection for ASC-11 for 3 months (data collection would commence with April 1, 2014 encounters) for the CY 2016 payment determination (<i class="E-03"><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier3&amp;cid=1228772879036" class="external wrap">https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier3&amp;amp;cid=1228772879036</a></i>). We issued additional guidance on April 2, 2014, stating that we would further delay the implementation of ASC-11 for an additional 9 months, until January 1, 2015 for the CY 2016 payment determination, due to continued concerns (<i class="E-03"><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier3&amp;cid=1228773811586" class="external wrap">https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier3&amp;amp;cid=1228773811586</a></i>).</p>

We would not subject ASCs to a payment reduction with respect to this measure for the CY 2016 payment determination.</p>
          <p id="p-2456" data-page="66984">We continue to believe that this measure addresses an area of care that is not adequately addressed in our current measure set and the measure serves to drive coordination of care (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75129">78 FR 75129</a>). Further, we believe ASCs should be a partner in care with physicians and other clinicians using their facility and that this measure provides an opportunity to do so. Therefore, we are continuing to include this measure in the ASCQR Program measure set for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. However, we understand the concerns and, therefore, proposed that data collection and submission be voluntary for this measure for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. ASCs would not be subject to a payment reduction for failing to report this measure during the period of voluntary reporting. For ASCs that choose to submit data, we continue to request that they submit such data using the means and timelines finalized in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75138">78 FR 75138</a> to 75139).

          <p id="p-2457" data-page="66984">We invited public comment on this proposal.</p>
          <p id="p-2458" data-page="66984">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Some commenters stated that complications following cataract surgery are not acceptable and believed that ASC-11 tracks patient-centered clinical outcomes. The commenters stated that the measure would promote and improve care coordination among providers. Some commenters commended CMS&apos; recognition of the associated operational issues and taking the approach to delay implementation of this measure as well as allowing voluntary collection.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate the commenters that supported and agreed with our view and the approach we take for this measure. We agree that complications following cataract surgery are not acceptable. While ASC-11 does not address complications following cataract surgery, it does address improvement in visual function following cataract surgery and it tracks an important patient-centered clinical outcome.</p>
          <p id="p-2460" data-page="66984">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Some commenters did not support voluntary data reporting based on concerns regarding the extent to which ASCs would report data for ASC-11 if reporting was voluntary. Some commenters stated that incomplete display of data is not meaningful to consumers. Other commenters expressed concerns that the display of data from some ASCs but not others would lead some patients to conclude that some ASCs are more committed to improving cataract surgery. Several other commenters predicted that very few ASCs will report data for the ASC-11 measure, leading to an insufficient sample.</p>
          <p id="p-2461" data-page="66984">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for their views. We note that the proposal, which we are finalizing in this final rule with comment period, is for the measure to be voluntarily reported by ASCs. Therefore, ASCs would be able to choose whether to implement data collection and reporting processes for this measure. We continue to believe the ASC-11 measure has value in this care setting. We do not agree that an insufficient sample of facilities will report data for the ASC-11 measure because we also have self-reports from ASCs that some did put processes in place to collect data for this measure, and that these ASCs would like to report data for this measure because they view the measure as an important quality measure for facilities.</p>

          <p id="p-2462" data-page="66984">We do not agree that ASC-11 data reported on a voluntary basis would not be meaningful for consumers. There are many situations where ASCs do not submit information to the ASCQR Program because they do not have such information due to lack of cases or low case volume. In the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74514">76 FR 74514</a> through 74515), we finalized a policy to make data that an ASC submitted for the ASCQR Program publicly available on a CMS Web site after providing an ASC an opportunity to review the data to be made public. Therefore, when ASCs&apos; information is submitted, we will make this information publicly available. Where this information is not submitted, we will state that the information is not<span id="page-66985" class="printed_page" data-page="66985"> </span>available. We also do not agree that reporting of measure data by some ASCs and not others under voluntary reporting would affect the validity of data reported for this Web-based measure because this situation is no different than any other measure where not all ASCs had cases.</p>
          <p id="p-2463" data-page="66985">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters requested that CMS remove the ASC-11 measure from the program entirely, rather than delaying implementation and allowing voluntary reporting. These commenters reiterated similar concerns expressed in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period regarding associated burden, suitability for ASCQR Program versus PQRS, program alignment of this measure, nonstandardization of collected information, NQF endorsement, MAP recommendation, and coordination challenges faced by facilities.</p>
          <p id="p-2464" data-page="66985">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We continue to believe this measure addresses the importance area of care coordination and responsibility for monitoring patient outcomes between performing physicians, practitioners that assess visual function, and facilities where procedures are performed; therefore, we are not removing ASC-11 from the ASCQR Program measure set for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <p id="p-2465" data-page="66985">With respect to the concerns raised by commenters about the measure, we refer commenters to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75124">78 FR 75124</a> through 75126, 75129, and 75138 through 75139) where we previously have responded to these concerns.</p>

ASCs will be able to begin reporting with January 1, 2015 services as described above in section XIV.E.3. of this final rule with comment period. For ASCs that choose to submit data, we request that they submit such data using the means and timelines finalized in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75138">78 FR 75138</a> to 75139).

In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41051">79 FR 41051</a>), we also proposed that, for this measure, which uses ASC Medicare claims data as specified in the ASCQR Specifications Manual and does not require any additional data submission such as QDCs, we would use paid Medicare FFS claims from a 12-month period from July 1 of the year 3 years before the payment determination year to June 30 of the following year. Thus, we stated, for the CY 2017 payment determination for this measure, claims from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015 would be used. We noted that we proposed to adopt this measure under the ASCQR Program as well as the Hospital OQR Program, as described in section XIII.H.2.c. of the proposed rule. We stated that this ASCQR Program time period provides for the timeliest data possible while aligning the proposed data submission requirements with our Hospital OQR Program proposal, which would use the claims-based measure data submission requirements for the CY 2015 payment determination and subsequent years that we adopted in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75111">78 FR 75111</a> through 75112).</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As we stated above in section XIV.B.5. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing the adoption of ASC-12 for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years instead of the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years as proposed. We are finalizing the data submission time period for ASC-12 to use paid Medicare FFS claims from the calendar year 2 years before the payment determination calendar year. For the CY 2018 payment determination, we will use paid Medicare FFS claims from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. We believe the reliability of the measure using 1 year of data is sufficiently reliable. While we believe that measure reliability may be further improved by using a longer time period, we must balance the reliability of the measure with the timeliness of the measure. At this time, we believe that 1 year of data appropriately balances these competing interests, but we will continue to assess this belief during the dry run.</p>

In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41051">79 FR 41051</a> through 41052, we proposed that for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years, ASCs would collect data from October 1 of the year 2 years prior to the payment determination year to March 31 of the year prior to the payment determination year. For example, the CY 2017 payment determination would require data collection from October 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016.</p>

We stated that this date is the latest date possible for data entry that would provide sufficient time for us to make the CY 2016 payment determinations and is aligned with the data entry deadline for the measures entered via the CMS online tool (<a href="/citation/78-FR-43670">78 FR 43670</a>).

For example, for the CY 2016 payment determination, ASCs would be required to submit their 2014-2015 influenza season data (October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015) by May 15, 2015. Similarly, for the CY 2017 payment determination, ASCs would be required to submit their 2015-2016 influenza season data (October 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016) by May 15, 2016. We believe a May 15 reporting deadline would enable ASCs to use data summarizing the results of their previous influenza vaccination campaign to set targets and make plans for their influenza vaccination campaigns prior to the next influenza season. This deadline also would enable us to post and the public to review the summary data before the start of the next influenza season. Finally, this date aligns to the May 15 deadline used in the Hospital IQR and OQR Programs for this measure.</p>
          <p id="p-2477" data-page="66986">We invited public comment on this proposal.</p>
          <p id="p-2478" data-page="66986">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Many commenters supported the proposed submission deadline of May 15 for ASC-8. One commenter expressed concern that there is a time lag for reporting this data, and urged that the public should have access to the data at the time the data is most useful.</p>
          <p id="p-2479" data-page="66986">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for their support.

This deadline also will enable us to post and the public to review the summary data before the start of the next influenza season. Finally, this date aligns with the May 15 deadline used in the Hospital IQR and OQR Programs for this measure.</p>
          <p id="p-2480" data-page="66986">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters opposed setting the submission deadline for ASC-8 to May 15, arguing that the August 15 deadline considered in the prior year rule was better aligned with the other measures in the ASCQR Program and would minimize confusion and reporting burden. One commenter suggested that the Hospital IQR and Hospital OQR Programs should move their deadlines to August 15 to support program alignment.</p>
          <p id="p-2481" data-page="66986">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for supporting last year&apos;s proposal regarding a data submission deadline for the ASC-8 measure. We proposed an August 15 data submission deadline in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-43670">78 FR 43670</a>), but did not finalize this proposal due to commenters&apos; concerns with nonalignment with other quality reporting programs (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75140">78 FR 75140</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-2482" data-page="66986">While we seek to align reporting deadlines whenever possible within the ASCQR Program (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75140">78 FR 75140</a>), we believe alignment across programs with the May 15 reporting deadline will prevent confusion in reporting across different facilities. We also believe this earlier deadline will enable us to make the data publicly available in time for ASCs to use the data summarizing the results of their previous influenza vaccination campaign to set targets and make plans for their influenza vaccination campaigns prior to the next influenza season. This would be very difficult to achieve with an August 15 reporting deadline.</p>
          <p id="p-2483" data-page="66986">After consideration of the public comments we received, for the reasons set forth above, we are finalizing our proposal without modification to adopt May 15 of the year in which the influenza season ends as the data submission deadline for the ASC-8 measure for each payment determination year, beginning with the CY 2016 payment determination. We also are finalizing our proposal without modification that, for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years, ASCs will collect data from October 1 of the year 2 years prior to the payment determination year to March 31 of the year prior to the payment determination year.</p>

In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41052">79 FR 41052</a>), we did not propose any changes to this policy.</p>

At this time, we believe that it would be overly burdensome to validate the reported data given the inexperience that ASCs have with reporting quality data to CMS coupled with the low incidence of cases for the claims-based measures. As we gain more experience with the ASCQR Program, we will reassess whether a data validation process for claims-based measures and measures where aggregate data are reported via an online tool is needed.</p>

<h4><a name="302"></a>A. Background</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Statutory Basis</b></p>
          <p id="p-2491" data-page="66987">Unless the requirements of an applicable exception are satisfied, section 1877 of the Act, also known as the &#x201C;physician self-referral law&#x201D;&#x2014;(1) prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services payable by Medicare to an entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship (ownership or compensation); and (2) prohibits the entity from submitting claims to Medicare (or billing another individual, entity, or third party payer) for those designated health services furnished as a result of a prohibited referral. The Act establishes a number of specific exceptions to the physician self-referral law and grants the Secretary the authority to create regulatory exceptions for financial relationships that the Secretary determines pose no risk of program or patient abuse. Since the original enactment of the statute in 1989, we have published a series of final rules interpreting the statute and promulgating numerous exceptions.</p>
          <p id="p-2492" data-page="66987">Section 1877(d) of the Act sets forth exceptions related to ownership and investment interests held by a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) in an entity that furnishes designated health services. Section 1877(d)(2) of the Act provides an exception for ownership and investment interests in rural providers. Under the provision of section 1877(d)(2) of the Act, in order for an ownership or investment interest to qualify for the exception, the designated health services must be furnished in a rural area (as defined in section 1886(d)(2) of the Act), and substantially all of the designated health services furnished by the entity must be furnished to individuals residing in a rural area. Section 1877(d)(3) of the Act provides the hospital ownership exception, often referred to as the &#x201C;whole hospital exception,&#x201D; for ownership and investment interests in a hospital located outside of Puerto Rico, provided that the referring physician is authorized to perform services at the hospital and the ownership or investment interest is in the hospital itself (and not merely in a subdivision of the hospital).</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Affordable Care Act Amendments to the Rural Provider and Hospital Ownership Exceptions to the Physician Self-Referral Law</b></p>
          <p id="p-2493" data-page="66987">Section 6001(a) of the Affordable Care Act amended the rural provider and whole hospital exceptions to the physician self-referral law to impose additional restrictions on physician ownership and investment in rural providers and hospitals. Section 6001(a) defines a &#x201C;physician owner or investor&#x201D; as a physician, or immediate family member of a physician, who has a direct or indirect ownership or investment interest in a hospital. We refer to hospitals with direct or indirect physician owners or investors as &#x201C;physician-owned hospitals.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="p-2494" data-page="66987">Section 6001(a)(3) of the Affordable Care Act established new section 1877(i) of the Act, which imposes additional requirements for physician-owned hospitals to qualify for the rural provider or whole hospital exception. In addition to other requirements, section 1877(i)(1) of the Act prohibits a physician-owned hospital from expanding its facility capacity beyond the number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds for which the hospital was licensed as of March 23, 2010, unless an exception is granted by the Secretary.</p>
          <p id="p-2495" data-page="66987">Section 1877(i)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to establish and implement an exception process to the prohibition on expansion of facility capacity. We refer to this process as the &#x201C;expansion exception process.&#x201D; Section 1877(i)(3)(A)(i) of the Act provides that a hospital qualifying as an &#x201C;applicable hospital&#x201D; or a &#x201C;high Medicaid facility&#x201D; may apply for an expansion exception. Section 1877(i)(3)(E) of the Act sets forth the eligibility criteria for applicable hospitals, which include criteria concerning inpatient Medicaid admissions, bed capacity, and bed occupancy. Section 1877(i)(3)(F) of the Act sets forth the eligibility criteria for high Medicaid facilities, which include a criterion concerning inpatient Medicaid admissions.</p>

          <p id="p-2496" data-page="66987">In the CY 2011 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/75-FR-72240">75 FR 72240</a>), we addressed many of the additional requirements that were established by section 6001(a) of the Affordable Care Act for the rural provider and whole hospital exceptions, including the prohibition on expansion of facility capacity. In that final rule with comment period, we finalized regulations at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-411.362">42 CFR 411.362</a>(b)(2) that prohibit a physician-owned hospital from increasing the number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds<span id="page-66988" class="printed_page" data-page="66988"> </span>beyond that for which the hospital was licensed on March 23, 2010 (or, in the case of a physician-owned hospital that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of that date, but did have a provider agreement in effect on December 31, 2010, the effective date of such agreement), if the hospital seeks to avail itself of the rural provider or whole hospital exception.</p>
          <p id="p-2497" data-page="66988">In the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74517">76 FR 74517</a>), we promulgated regulations under <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-411.362">42 CFR 411.362</a>(c) that govern the expansion exception process. Section 411.362(c)(2) sets forth the criteria for a physician-owned hospital to qualify for an expansion exception as an applicable hospital. Specifically, &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2) states that: (1) The hospital&apos;s annual percent of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid must be equal to or greater than the average percent with respect to such admissions for all hospitals located in the county in which the hospital is located during the most recent fiscal year for which data are available as of the date that the hospital submits its exception request; (2) the hospital must be located in a State in which the average bed capacity in the State is less than the national average bed capacity during the most recent fiscal year for which data are available as of the date that the hospital submits its request; and (3) the hospital must have an average bed occupancy rate that is greater than the average bed occupancy rate in the State in which the hospital is located during the most recent fiscal year for which data are available as of the date that the hospital submits its request.</p>
          <p id="p-2498" data-page="66988">Section 411.362(c)(3) specifies the criteria for a physician-owned hospital seeking an exception under the expansion exception process on the basis that it is a high Medicaid facility, including the requirement that, with respect to each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available as of the date that the hospital submits its exception request, the hospital must have an annual percent of total inpatient admissions under Medicaid that is estimated to be greater than such percent with respect to such admissions for any other hospital located in the county in which the hospital is located.</p>
          <p id="p-2499" data-page="66988">In the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/76-FR-42350">76 FR 42350</a> through 42352), we proposed that filed Medicare hospital cost report data from the CMS Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) be used to determine whether a hospital satisfies the inpatient Medicaid admissions, bed capacity, and bed occupancy criteria for applicable hospitals and the inpatient Medicaid admissions criterion for high Medicaid facilities. We requested public comments concerning alternative data sources that could result in more accurate determinations as to whether a hospital satisfies the relevant criteria (<a href="/citation/76-FR-42350">76 FR 42350</a>). The public comments that we received provided no persuasive support for a data source more accurate than the filed hospital cost report data reported to HCRIS. Therefore, we finalized the requirement to use filed hospital cost report data for purposes of facility capacity expansion exception requests in the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74518">76 FR 74518</a>). In this final rule with comment period, we refer to the filed hospital cost report data that are required under our existing regulations as &#x201C;HCRIS data.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="p-2500" data-page="66988">As required by section 1877(i)(3)(A) of the Act, the regulations addressing the expansion exception process in the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period were issued by January 1, 2012, and the process was implemented on February 1, 2012.</p>

<h4><a name="305"></a>B. Limitations Identified by Stakeholders Regarding the Required Use of HCRIS Data</h4>

          <p id="p-2501" data-page="66988">Following the implementation of the expansion exception process on February 1, 2012, industry stakeholders informed us of what they believed to be certain limitations regarding the required use of HCRIS data under the regulations at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-411.362">42 CFR 411.362</a>. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41053">79 FR 41053</a>), we discussed the existing required use of HCRIS data and certain limitations of the data that were identified by stakeholders and CMS. We do not repeat that information here; rather, we refer readers to the proposed rule for a complete discussion of the issues. To address the limitations regarding the required use of HCRIS data, we proposed to modify the expansion exception process to permit the use of certain non-HCRIS data sources for the inpatient Medicaid admissions, bed capacity, and bed occupancy criteria.</p>
          <p id="p-2502" data-page="66988">As of the publication date of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, a correctly completed hospital cost report did not include Medicaid managed care admissions or discharges and, therefore, Medicaid managed care admissions and discharges were not available in HCRIS. As a result, the information collected to date through HCRIS cannot be used to estimate reliably Medicaid managed care admissions or discharges for purposes of estimating the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions under &#xA7;&#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii). In addition, a hospital that has not participated as a provider in the Medicare program for each of the 3 most recent fiscal years for which data is available would be precluded from seeking a facility expansion exception as a high Medicaid facility. It would be similarly prohibitive if the requesting hospital is seeking an exception as either an applicable hospital or high Medicaid facility, and the hospitals in the county in which the requesting hospital is located were not Medicare participating providers or were not participating in the Medicare program during each of the years for which comparisons are required under the statute and our regulations.</p>
          <p id="p-2503" data-page="66988">We believe that some physician-owned hospitals that serve a significant number of Medicaid managed care patients and are interested in the expansion exception process may fail to qualify for an exception due to the exclusion of Medicaid managed care data. Accordingly, as detailed in section XV.C. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41054">79 FR 41054</a>), we proposed to revise the expansion exception process to permit physician-owned hospitals to use filed hospital cost report data, data from internal data sources, or data from external data sources to estimate the required percentages of inpatient admissions under Medicaid. (We referred in the proposal to the non-HCRIS internal data sources and external data sources that we proposed to permit for purposes of the expansion exception process as &#x201C;supplemental data sources.&#x201D;) Also, as explained in section XV.B. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41054">79 FR 41054</a>), we proposed to revise the expansion exception process to permit the use of supplemental data sources for the bed capacity and bed occupancy criteria for applicable hospitals.</p>

<h4><a name="306"></a>C. Changes to the Physician-Owned Hospital Expansion Exception Process</h4>

          <p id="p-2504" data-page="66988">Below we discuss the provisions of the proposed rule and summarize and respond to the public comments we received in response to our proposals. For ease of reference, we have divided the comments and responses into the following categories: supplemental data sources; fiscal year standard; community input and timing of complete request; and additional considerations.</p>
          <br><p><b>1. Supplemental Data Sources</b></p>

          <p id="p-2505" data-page="66988">Given the limitations regarding the required use of HCRIS data (which we described in sections XV.B.1. and XV.B.2. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41053">79 FR 41053</a> through 41054)), we proposed to revise our<span id="page-66989" class="printed_page" data-page="66989"> </span>regulations at &#xA7;&#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iv), (c)(2)(v), and (c)(3)(ii) to permit physician-owned hospitals to use data from certain internal data sources or external data sources, in addition to HCRIS data, in order to estimate the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions, and to determine the bed capacities and the bed occupancy rates referenced in those sections. We stated in the proposed rule that we were not prescribing that hospitals use a specific individual data source or combination of data sources.</p>
          <p id="p-2506" data-page="66989">We proposed that, for purposes of the expansion exception process, internal data sources would be sources generated, maintained, or under the control of the Department, and we gave as examples the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), and the Medicaid Analytic Extract (MAX). We sought public comments that recommended other possible internal data sources. We also proposed that, for purposes of the expansion exception process, &#x201C;external data sources&#x201D; would be data sources generated, maintained, or under the control of a State Medicaid agency, and we sought public comments that recommended other possible external data sources, including those of other State agencies or departments. Finally, we proposed to amend <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-411.351">42 CFR 411.351</a>: (1) to define &#x201C;internal data source&#x201D; to include only non-HCRIS data sources that are reliable and transparent, and that maintain or generate data that are accurate, complete, and objectively verifiable for purposes of the expansion exception process, and to define &#x201C;external data source&#x201D; to include only data sources that are reliable and transparent, and that maintain or generate data that are accurate, complete, and objectively verifiable for purposes of the expansion exception process; and (2) to state that internal data sources and external data sources must maintain data that are readily available and accessible to the requesting hospital, comparison hospitals, and to CMS for purposes of the expansion exception process.</p>
          <p id="p-2507" data-page="66989">We noted in the proposed rule that the expansion exception process includes both the physician-owned hospital&apos;s completion of its request and CMS&apos; consideration of the physician-owned hospital&apos;s request.</p>
          <p id="p-2508" data-page="66989">We stated in the proposed rule that we believe that the supplemental data sources should&#x2014;</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-2509" data-page="66989"> Be transparent regarding what comprises the data, where the data originated, and the manner and method by which the data source received the data;</li>
          <li id="p-2510" data-page="66989"> Be maintained on a secure database that prevents distortion or corruption of data and that ensures the accuracy of the data;</li>
          <li id="p-2511" data-page="66989"> Contain sufficient information to enable accurate estimates of the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions, and accurate determinations of bed capacities and bed occupancy rates;</li>
          <li id="p-2512" data-page="66989"> Contain sufficient information to enable the comparisons required by &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iv), (c)(2)(v), and (c)(3)(ii) for the fiscal year(s) at issue; and</li>
          <li id="p-2513" data-page="66989"> Contain sufficiently clear and detailed data that will enable multiple users to produce consistent results and outcomes when using the same data set.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-2514" data-page="66989">In the proposed rule, we recognized that, if a physician-owned hospital uses data from a supplemental data source, the hospital may ultimately need to make estimates or determinations in addition to those referenced in our existing regulations. Accordingly, we proposed to revise our regulations to allow for the additional estimates or determinations that may be necessary under our revised process. Specifically, we proposed to permit a requesting hospital to use data from a supplemental data source to:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">

          <p id="p-2523" data-page="66989">We respond below to the specific comments that we received in response to our proposal.</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Internal Data Sources</b></p>
          <p id="p-2524" data-page="66989">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> All of the commenters supported CMS&apos; efforts to permit physician-owned hospitals to use supplemental data sources in the expansion exception process because of the limitations of the HCRIS data, especially with respect to the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria. The commenters generally agreed that a more flexible approach would help ensure that the physician-owned hospitals that satisfy the statutory criteria are able to expand facility capacity under the CMS process.</p>
          <p id="p-2525" data-page="66989">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate the commenters&apos; support. Accordingly, we are finalizing a number of our proposals to revise the expansion exception process to provide for the flexibility called for by the commenters and other industry stakeholders to effectuate the purpose of section 6001(a) of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
          <p id="p-2526" data-page="66989">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter stated that it appreciated CMS&apos; efforts to permit physician-owned hospitals to use supplemental data sources but also expressed concern that an internal data source as defined in the proposed rule would have limited utility in the expansion exception process. With respect to the internal data sources provided as examples in the proposed rule, the commenter identified limitations concerning the data sources&apos; completeness for purposes of the expansion exception process. Specifically, the commenter stated that certain States do not provide information to the HCUP and that the MSIS does not provide sufficient detail at the State or county level for purposes of the expansion exception process. The commenter added that the Medicaid Analytic Extract (MAX) would not be appropriate for the expansion exception process because it may not be used for nonresearch purposes.</p>
          <p id="p-2527" data-page="66989">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We share the concerns identified by the commenter. After publication of the proposed rule, we made additional inquiries into the utility of internal data sources with respect to the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria. As a result of those inquiries and further review, we agree with the commenter that these data sources contain significant limitations, including incomplete data for purposes of the exception process, as well as issues related to timeliness, availability, and accessibility of the data. Accordingly, we do not believe that the three sources listed in the proposed rule satisfy all of the standards that we set forth in the proposed rule for supplemental data sources (79 FR<span id="page-66990" class="printed_page" data-page="66990"> </span>41055), which we continue to believe are critical for any supplemental data source that could be used in the expansion exception process. None of the commenters provided information regarding other potentially acceptable internal data sources, and we are unaware of any other internal data sources that could be used to estimate accurately and reliably the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions required. Therefore, we are not finalizing our proposal to permit the use of any non-HCRIS internal data source for the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria required at &#xA7;&#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii).</p>
          <p id="p-2528" data-page="66990">We also believe that many of the limitations that the commenter and our review identified regarding the proposed internal data sources would also apply to the bed capacity and bed occupancy criteria at &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v). Specifically, we do not believe that internal data sources other than HCRIS would include relevant and adequate information to determine accurately the average bed capacity for hospitals within a State or nationally; nor do we believe internal data sources other than HCRIS would include information to determine accurately bed occupancy rates in a State. Accordingly, we are not finalizing our proposed revisions to &#xA7;&#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v) that would permit the use of any non-HCRIS internal data source for those criteria. Because no internal data source, other than HCRIS, will be permitted in the expansion exception process under this final rule with comment period, we are not finalizing our proposal to add a definition of &#x201C;internal data source&#x201D; to &#xA7; 411.351.</p>
          <p id="p-2529" data-page="66990">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter recommended that physician-owned hospitals be allowed to use as an internal data source the same Medicaid eligibility determination process that hospitals use for Medicare disproportionate share hospital (DSH) determinations.</p>
          <p id="p-2530" data-page="66990">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Medicare DSH determinations are based on Medicaid days, not admissions (or discharges). Based on our review, we do not believe that Medicaid days, without additional detailed information for the requesting and each comparison hospital, could be used in calculations to estimate accurately or reliably the required percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions. The commenter did not explain how Medicaid eligibility data could be used to estimate inpatient admissions under Medicaid for the requesting hospital and each comparison hospital, when required. Without further explanation, we cannot agree that the Medicaid eligibility determination process that hospitals use for Medicare DSH determinations should be considered a data source.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. External Data Sources</b></p>
          <p id="p-2531" data-page="66990">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Most commenters urged CMS to finalize its proposal to permit the use of data from external data sources for the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria. One commenter stated that its State Medicaid agency&apos;s data on inpatient Medicaid admissions includes fee-for-service and managed care data, and that the data on total patient admissions are readily available from the Medicaid agency. The commenter indicated that the State Medicaid agency data could be used to determine accurately the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions referenced in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii). The commenter also stated that the State did not charge a fee for providing the necessary data.</p>
          <p id="p-2532" data-page="66990">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We believe that States have a significant interest in ensuring that data generated, maintained, or under the control of the State Medicaid agency are accurate and reliable. In general, submission of data to a State Medicaid agency is not voluntary, and hospitals are incented to provide accurate data and other information to receive payment for the services that they provide to the State&apos;s Medicaid enrollees. Accordingly, we are persuaded to finalize our proposal to permit the use of an external data source for the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria at &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii) with the modification stemming from the recent revision to the Medicare hospital cost report described in this response. We also are adopting as final our proposed definition of &#x201C;external data source&#x201D; with no modification. We are adding this definition at &#xA7; 411.362(a), rather than at &#xA7; 411.351 as proposed, because the definition of &#x201C;external data source&#x201D; applies only to our regulations at &#xA7; 411.362.</p>

          <p id="p-2533" data-page="66990">We note that CMS recently revised the hospital cost report to require the reporting of Medicaid managed care discharges in addition to Medicaid fee-for-service discharges. As a result of this revision, a correctly completed hospital cost report will include Medicaid managed care discharges and, thus, Medicaid managed care discharges eventually will be available in HCRIS. At such time, the limitations that led to our proposal will be resolved, and HCRIS should be sufficiently complete to estimate the percentages of Medicaid inpatient admissions required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii). However, we anticipate that it will take several years before physician-owned hospitals that are interested in requesting an expansion exception will be able to utilize the necessary Medicaid managed care data through HCRIS. Therefore, we are permitting physician-owned hospitals to use data from an external data source for the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria until such time that the Secretary determines that HCRIS contains sufficiently complete inpatient Medicaid discharge data. At that time, going forward, physician-owned hospitals may use only filed Medicare hospital cost report data for the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria. For additional information about the recent revisions to the hospital cost report, we refer readers to Transmittal 6 on the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/2014-Transmittals-Items/R6P240.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/2014-Transmittals-Items/R6P240.html</a></i>.</p>
          <p id="p-2534" data-page="66990">We did not receive any public comments regarding whether an external data source would contain adequate information to determine the remaining four calculations required for the Secretary to grant an exception to the facility expansion prohibition for an applicable hospital (that is, the average bed capacity in the State where the requesting hospital is located, national average bed capacity, the requesting hospital&apos;s average bed occupancy, and the average bed occupancy for all hospitals in the State where the requesting hospital is located). Based on our own review, we do not believe that an external data source would meet the standards set forth in the proposed rule when used for the criteria at &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v). Therefore, we are not finalizing our proposal to permit the use of external data sources for the four calculations specified in this paragraph and, thus, we are limiting the use of external data sources to the estimations of the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions at &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii).</p>
          <p id="p-2535" data-page="66990">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter suggested that physician-owned hospitals seeking an expansion exception be permitted to use the most current external data available, regardless of source.</p>
          <p id="p-2536" data-page="66990">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We interpret the comment as a suggestion that a requesting hospital should be able to use multiple external data sources to achieve the goal of using the &#x201C;most current&#x201D; data available when requesting an expansion exception, provided that each data source meets the criteria for an &#x201C;external data source.&#x201D; We disagree with the commenter because we believe that the use of more than one data<span id="page-66991" class="printed_page" data-page="66991"> </span>source would add unnecessary complexity to the Secretary&apos;s review and lead to inconsistent results, including from year to year where multiple-year comparisons are required. In order to ensure accurate and consistent estimates and determinations and to facilitate the Secretary&apos;s review of a physician-owned hospital&apos;s request for a facility expansion exception, all of the data necessary for a physician-owned hospital to estimate or determine the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions referenced in &#xA7;&#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii) must come from a single data source. Specifically, the same data source, whether HCRIS or an external data source, must be used in the numerator and denominator when determining or estimating the percentages of inpatient admissions under Medicaid for the requesting hospital and any other comparison hospital required under &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii). We will continue to monitor the use of data sources in the expansion exception process and, if necessary, we will provide additional guidance on the CMS Web site regarding how an external data source should be used for the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria.</p>
          <p id="p-2537" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter identified potential shortcomings in the data that its State Medicaid agency collects. Specifically, this commenter stated that its State collects Medicaid inpatient admissions data from general acute care hospitals but not psychiatric or specialty hospitals. (The commenter did not define &#x201C;specialty hospital.&#x201D;) For this reason, the commenter claimed that its State Medicaid agency data would be incomplete if the requesting hospital is a psychiatric or specialty hospital or must compare itself to a psychiatric or specialty hospital.</p>
          <p id="p-2538" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Although we understand the potential implication of a State Medicaid agency not requiring a particular type of hospital to report admissions (or discharges) data to the agency, we note that HCRIS remains available under the policies set forth in this final rule with comment period. No Medicare participating hospital is exempt from reporting cost report data in HCRIS. Hospitals requesting an exception to the Affordable Care Act&apos;s facility expansion prohibition may use HCRIS data to make the necessary estimates and determinations required under the statute and our regulations.</p>
          <p id="p-2539" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter recommended that physician-owned hospitals be permitted to use a State-provided listing of Medicaid DSH-eligible hospitals as an external data source. The commenter suggested that, if a hospital has been determined by its State Medicaid agency to be eligible for Medicaid DSH payments, the supporting data that show the Medicaid inpatient utilization rate or low-income utilization rate status of the hospital would be an adequate external data source.</p>
          <p id="p-2540" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We do not believe that a listing of Medicaid DSH-eligible hospitals, even if developed by a State Medicaid agency, qualifies as an external data source under our proposed definition. Moreover, we are not persuaded to expand the definition of &#x201C;external data source&#x201D; to include such a listing because we are unclear how a listing, by itself, could provide the data necessary to estimate the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions required under the statute and our regulations.</p>
          <p id="p-2541" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter suggested that admissions data, which it was able to obtain from the State health and human services commission, should be preferred over discharge data for purposes of the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria.</p>
          <p id="p-2542" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> In the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74519">76 FR 74519</a>), we determined that discharge data may be used to estimate the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions. We did not propose to revise this policy in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. However, we are clarifying in this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period that either admissions data or discharge data may be used to either determine or estimate the percentages referenced in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii), provided that the data being used are from a permitted data source. We are not persuaded to rank or prioritize these types of data. The Secretary will determine whether an estimate is accurate or appropriate given the specific facts and circumstances underlying a physician-owned hospital&apos;s expansion exception request.</p>
          <br><p><b>c. Completeness of Supplemental Data Sources</b></p>
          <p id="p-2543" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter expressed concern about the utility of an external data source, as defined in the proposed rule, for purposes of the expansion exception process. The commenter stated that, in some States, certain types of hospitals are not required to report any data to the States in which they are located. The commenter did not provide information regarding whether State Medicaid agencies can or do generate on their own (that is, without relying on reported information from hospitals) inpatient admissions data for those hospitals not required to report such data. The commenter requested that CMS clarify whether the State Medicaid sources would be considered &#x201C;complete&#x201D; for purposes of the expansion exception process under such circumstances.</p>
          <p id="p-2544" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We recognize the possibility that a State Medicaid agency may not generate, maintain, or otherwise control a data source that would contain sufficient data for the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria, the only eligibility criteria for which we are permitting the use of an external data source in this final rule with comment period. Thus, the utility of the external data sources that we are permitting likely will depend on the State in which the physician-owned hospital is located.</p>
          <p id="p-2545" data-page="66991">Whether an external data source is considered complete depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. For example, if a physician-owned hospital is seeking to qualify as a high Medicaid facility and the State&apos;s data source does not include data on one of the comparison hospitals, the State&apos;s data would not be considered complete for purposes of the process because a high Medicaid facility must compare itself against each other hospital in the county in which it is located.</p>
          <br><p><b>d. Other Issues Related to Supplemental Data Sources</b></p>
          <p id="p-2546" data-page="66991">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter expressed concern that contradictory data sources could create confusion for requesting physician-owned hospitals, those who wish to comment on an expansion exception request, and the Secretary in her review of a request. The commenter provided an example where a physician-owned hospital chooses to utilize available HCRIS data for its expansion request, but the available data from the State Medicaid agency conflict with the HCRIS data, appearing to show that the physician-owned hospital was not the highest Medicaid facility in a more recent fiscal year(s). Two commenters recommended that CMS consider issuing guidance as to how external data sources will be characterized or measured in comparison to HCRIS data, how CMS and the Secretary will evaluate comments received from opposing hospitals, and what criteria the Secretary intends to rely upon to make the ultimate determinations. Another commenter recommended that CMS not prioritize or rank additional data sources, given that access to supplemental data sources will vary based upon the entity requesting an expansion exception.<span id="page-66992" class="printed_page" data-page="66992"> </span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-2547" data-page="66992">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Determinations regarding expansion exception requests will be made on a case-by-case basis, with consideration given to all information available to CMS at the time of the review. We are not able to provide the specific guidance requested by the first commenter because the example provided is hypothetical in nature and not part of an actual request for the Secretary&apos;s consideration. As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe that permissible data sources should, among other things, be transparent, be secure, enable accurate estimates of the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions, and provide for consistent results in order to enable the Secretary to make an informed decision regarding whether a requesting physician-owned hospital satisfies the statutory requirements for an exception to the facility expansion prohibition. We continue to believe in the importance of these attributes, and all data sources utilized by a requesting hospital and any community comments provided during the exception expansion process will be evaluated with them in mind. Because each request will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, we decline to issue guidance regarding the relative priority of data sources. The Secretary will make determinations based on the criteria enumerated in the Affordable Care Act, as set forth in section 1877(i)(3) of the Act and our regulations.</p>
          <p id="p-2548" data-page="66992">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter recommended that, in addition to considering other data sources, CMS consider other factors when reviewing an expansion exception request. The commenter claimed that Medicaid patient days are a better metric than Medicaid admissions because Medicaid patient days reflect a hospital&apos;s use of resources to care for a Medicaid patient. The commenter also suggested that CMS consider the specialty services, such as neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) services, that a hospital provides. Specifically, the commenter suggested that CMS consider the bed occupancy of a particular specialty service if that service treats a very large Medicaid population.</p>
          <p id="p-2549" data-page="66992">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We do not have the authority to revise the expansion exception process to incorporate the factors that the commenter recommended. Section 6001(a) of the Affordable Care Act established criteria that physician-owned hospitals must satisfy in order to qualify for an expansion exception request, including criteria concerning inpatient Medicaid admissions. As we understand the comment, the commenter is recommending that we substitute (or additionally consider) a hospital&apos;s inpatient Medicaid days as a criterion for granting an exception to the prohibition on facility expansion. The statute does not provide the Secretary discretion to consider inpatient Medicaid days in lieu of the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria. Similarly, we lack the authority to consider the bed occupancy of specific specialty services, a factor which, even if permissible, would complicate our review of an exception request.</p>
          <br><p><b>e. Summary of Final Provisions Regarding Supplemental Data Sources</b></p>
          <p id="p-2550" data-page="66992">After consideration of the public comments we received on the use of supplemental data sources, we are not finalizing the proposed revisions to &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii) that would permit physician-owned hospitals to use data from an internal data source other than HCRIS to estimate the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions referenced in those sections. Accordingly, we are not finalizing our proposal to add a definition of the term &#x201C;internal data source&#x201D; under &#xA7; 411.351. As finalized, &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii) reflect modifications from our proposal that would have permitted physician-owned hospitals to use data from an external data source to estimate the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions referenced in those sections. Specifically, we are revising these sections to require the use of HCRIS data once they are complete and permit the use of data from an external data source only until then. We also are finalizing the definition of &#x201C;external data source&#x201D; without modification, although we are adding the definition at &#xA7; 411.362(a), rather than at &#xA7; 411.351 as proposed. Finally, we are not finalizing the proposed revisions to those sections that would permit physician-owned hospitals to use data from a non-HCRIS data source to determine State average bed capacity, national averaged bed capacity, the requesting physician-owned hospital&apos;s average bed occupancy rate, or the State average bed occupancy rate. We provide the following chart of the final provisions to assist the reader.</p>

          <p id="p-2551" data-page="66993">Section 1877(i)(3)(F) of the Act requires that a high Medicaid facility use data from each of the 3 most recent fiscal years for which data are available. In the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74518">76 FR 74518</a>), we stated that we consider the most recent fiscal year for which data are available to be the most recent year for which HCRIS contains data from at least 6,100 hospitals. We currently apply this standard to expansion exception requests for both applicable hospitals and high Medicaid facilities.</p>
          <p id="p-2552" data-page="66993">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41055">79 FR 41055</a>), we proposed to revise our standard so that the most recent fiscal year for which data are available would be the year for which the data source(s) used in an expansion exception request contain sufficient data to perform the comparisons required under &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iv), (c)(2)(v), and (c)(3)(ii). Specifically, we proposed that data sources, either alone or in combination with other data sources, would be considered to contain &#x201C;sufficient data&#x201D; if they contain all data from the requesting hospital and each hospital to which the requesting hospital must compare itself that are necessary to perform the estimates required in the expansion exception process. In addition, with respect to a hospital seeking an expansion exception as an applicable hospital, we proposed that, in order to be considered to contain &#x201C;sufficient data,&#x201D; the data sources, either alone or in combination with other data sources, must contain the data necessary to determine the State and national average bed capacity and the average bed occupancy rate in the State in which the requesting hospital is located for purposes of the expansion exception process.</p>
          <p id="p-2553" data-page="66993">We also proposed to require that data from the same fiscal year be used for the applicable hospital eligibility criteria at &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v), even if the hospital uses multiple data sources for those criteria. We stated our belief that requiring the use of data from the same fiscal year will ensure consistency and equitability in the expansion exception process. We sought public comments on our proposal to revise the standard that determines the most recent fiscal year(s) for which data are available, as well as other ways to define &#x201C;sufficient data&#x201D; for purposes of the expansion exception process.</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Summary of Public Comments and Our Responses Regarding the Fiscal Year Standard</b></p>
          <p id="p-2554" data-page="66993">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> All of the commenters that addressed this issue supported CMS&apos; proposal to revise the interpretation of the standard &#x201C;the most recent fiscal year for which data are available.&#x201D; The commenters stated generally that external data sources often have more recent data than the fiscal year for which HCRIS contains data from at least 6,100 hospitals. Two commenters recommended deeming a data source &#x201C;sufficient&#x201D; and, thus, acceptable for use in an expansion exception request, if it contains all of the information necessary to complete the calculations required to determine eligibility for an exception as a high Medicaid facility or applicable hospital. Another commenter similarly supported the proposal and suggested that CMS consider the sufficiency of data on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p id="p-2555" data-page="66993">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We agree with the commenters that recommended that we deem a data source &#x201C;sufficient&#x201D; and, thus, acceptable for use in an expansion exception request, if it contains all of the information necessary to complete the calculations required to determine eligibility for an exception as a high Medicaid facility or applicable hospital. Although determining the sufficiency of a data source on a case-by-case basis could significantly lengthen the period of time required for a thorough review of an expansion exception request, we believe that evaluating the sufficiency of data on a modified case-by-case basis is nonetheless appropriate, as explained more fully below.</p>
          <p id="p-2556" data-page="66993">We are adopting separate standards to determine the sufficiency of data sources for the Medicaid inpatient admissions criteria and the bed capacity and occupancy criteria set forth in our regulations. For purposes of the Medicaid inpatient admissions estimates required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii), we are adopting a standard under which we will consider a data source sufficient when it contains data from the requesting hospital and every hospital located in the same county as the requesting hospital. This applies to both external data sources and HCRIS. The statutory criteria at sections 1877(i)(3)(E)(ii) and (i)(3)(F)(ii) of the Act afford no flexibility to make these determinations based on data from fewer than all of the hospitals located in the same county as the requesting hospital. For purposes of the bed capacity and occupancy determinations required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v), we will consider HCRIS sufficient for a particular fiscal year on a State-by-State basis, rather than the current &#x201C;6,100 hospitals reporting&#x201D; standard. Specifically, this final rule with comment period requires a requesting physician-owned hospital to satisfy the bed capacity criterion in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) during the most recent fiscal year for which HCRIS contains data from a sufficient number of hospitals in the requester&apos;s State to determine the State&apos;s average bed capacity and a sufficient number of hospitals nationally to determine the national average bed capacity. In addition, this final rule with comment period requires a requesting physician-owned hospital to satisfy the bed occupancy criterion in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(v) during the most recent fiscal year for which HCRIS contains data from a sufficient number of hospitals in the State to determine the requesting hospital&apos;s average bed occupancy rate and the State&apos;s average bed occupancy rate. &#x201C;Sufficient number&#x201D; means that enough hospitals have reported data such that the determinations in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v) would not materially change after additional hospital data are reported.</p>

          <p id="p-2557" data-page="66993">We will consult with the CMS Office of the Actuary to determine whether average bed capacity and bed occupancy rates would materially change upon additional hospital reporting. CMS intends to report on its Web site each State&apos;s average bed capacity, the national average bed capacity, and each State&apos;s average bed occupancy, per fiscal year, as they become available. A<span id="page-66994" class="printed_page" data-page="66994"> </span>requesting physician-owned hospital may use only the averages posted on the CMS Web site as of the date that the hospital submits its expansion exception request.</p>
          <p id="p-2558" data-page="66994">We provide the following examples to illustrate the application of the standard applicable to the determinations required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v). Assume that, for FY 2013, the requesting hospital is one of 200 Medicare-participating hospitals located in State A. Assume also that, after consultation with the CMS Office of the Actuary, we determine that State A&apos;s FY 2013 average bed capacity and bed occupancy rates would not materially change once HCRIS contains data from at least 85 percent of State A hospitals (170 hospitals). Finally, assume that CMS is able to determine the FY 2013 national average bed capacity rate once 5,500 hospitals have reported bed capacity data in HCRIS, and that this rate would not materially change even if the remaining Medicare-participating hospitals reported data in HCRIS. Under the standard adopted in this final rule with comment period, the requesting hospital may use FY 2013 HCRIS data to make the State bed capacity and occupancy determinations required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v) once HCRIS contains data from at least 170 of the Medicare-participating hospitals in State A for that fiscal year. The requesting hospital may use FY 2013 HCRIS data to determine the national average bed capacity required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) once HCRIS contains data from at least 5,500 Medicare-participating hospitals for that fiscal year.</p>
          <p id="p-2559" data-page="66994">In contrast, assume that, for FY 2013, there are only 10 Medicare-participating hospitals in State B. Assume also that, after consultation with the CMS Office of the Actuary, we determine that State B&apos;s FY 2013 average bed capacity and bed occupancy rates would materially change unless HCRIS contains data from all of State B&apos;s hospitals. Thus, a physician-owned hospital located in State B could not use FY 2013 HCRIS data until all 10 Medicare-participating hospitals in State B reported their bed capacity and occupancy data in HCRIS for that fiscal year.</p>
          <p id="p-2560" data-page="66994">With respect to external data sources, because we recognize that State Medicaid agencies likely will have varying collection time periods that may not line up with the Federal fiscal year end for which HCRIS data are available (for example, calendar year or State fiscal year), we are permitting the use of any 12-month period for the data, provided that all 3 years use the same 12-month cycle. For example, a State Medicaid agency may collect Medicaid inpatient admissions data on a calendar year cycle. A physician-owned hospital requesting an expansion exception as a high Medicaid facility may use calendar years 2013, 2012 and 2011 if the external data source, for each of those years, contains all data from the requesting hospital and every hospital located in the same county as the requesting hospital.</p>
          <p id="p-2561" data-page="66994">We note that, if the latest year for which HCRIS contained data sufficient to determine the average bed capacity in the State in which the requesting hospital is located and the national bed capacity was FY 2011, but HCRIS contained FY 2012 data sufficient to determine the requesting hospital&apos;s own average bed occupancy and the average bed occupancy rate for the State in which the requesting hospital is located, the hospital could use FY 2011 data for the determinations required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and FY 2012 data for the determinations required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(v). We recognize that using different years from the same permissible data source to make the estimates or determinations set forth in the criteria for applicable hospitals may require additional review of an expansion exception request by the Secretary. However, in light of our interpretation that each criterion that a physician-owned hospital seeking a facility expansion exception must meet is analyzed separately, we believe that allowing a requesting hospital to use data from 12-month periods that may be different for each criterion will permit use of the most recent data, result in more accurate determinations, and best effectuate the plain meaning of the statutory and regulatory language regarding these criteria.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Summary of Final Provisions Regarding the Fiscal Year Standard</b></p>
          <p id="p-2562" data-page="66994">After consideration of the public comments we received on the standard regarding the most recent available data, we are finalizing our proposals with several modifications. For purposes of the estimates required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii), the most recent 12-month period for which data are available is the most recent 12-month period for which the data source used contains all data from the requesting hospital and each hospital to which the requesting hospital must compare itself. For purposes of the determinations required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv), we require a requesting physician-owned hospital to satisfy the criterion during the most recent fiscal year for which HCRIS contains data from a sufficient number of hospitals to determine the relevant State&apos;s average bed capacity and the national average bed capacity. For purposes of the determinations required in &#xA7; 411.362 (c)(2)(v), we require a requesting physician-owned hospital to satisfy the criterion during the most recent fiscal year for which HCRIS contains data from a sufficient number of hospitals to determine the requesting hospital&apos;s average bed occupancy rate and the relevant State&apos;s average bed occupancy rate. Because we are continuing to require the use of HCRIS data for the determinations required in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v), we believe that this bifurcated approach is necessary.</p>
          <p id="p-2563" data-page="66994">Finally, we note that we analyze each estimate or determination required under &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2) separately. We interpret the statute and our regulations to allow the use of different time periods for each estimate or determination, provided that the data source (or time period) used to perform the necessary calculation contains: (1) for purposes of &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii), all data from the requesting hospital and each hospital to which the requesting hospital must compare itself; (2) for purposes of &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv), data from a sufficient number of hospitals to determine the relevant State&apos;s average bed capacity and the national average bed capacity; and (3) for purposes of &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(v), data from a sufficient number of hospitals to determine the requesting hospital&apos;s average bed occupancy rate and the relevant State&apos;s average bed occupancy rate, respectively. CMS will continue to determine and make available on its Web site State bed capacity and occupancy rates and the national average bed capacity rate. &#x201C;Sufficient number&#x201D; means that enough hospitals have reported data such that the determinations in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(v) would not materially change even if data that may be missing from comparison hospitals were included.</p>
          <br><p><b>3. Community Input and Timing of a Complete Request</b></p>

          <p id="p-2564" data-page="66994">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41055">79 FR 41055</a> through 41056), we proposed to require that a physician-owned hospital requesting an expansion exception provide actual notification directly to hospitals whose data are part of the comparisons set forth under &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii) of the regulations. Under proposed &#xA7; 411.362(c)(5), the notification must be in writing, in either electronic or hard copy form, and must be provided at the same time that the hospital discloses on<span id="page-66995" class="printed_page" data-page="66995"> </span>any public Web site for the hospital that it is requesting an exception. We stated in the proposed rule that we believe that this additional safeguard would ensure that comparison hospitals are aware of the opportunity to confirm or dispute the accuracy or reliability of the data in the physician-owned hospital&apos;s request.</p>

          <p id="p-2565" data-page="66995">Our existing regulations at &#xA7; 411.362(c)(5) set forth the process for community input and the timing of a complete expansion exception request. These regulations provide for a 30-day comment period following publication in the <span class="E-04">Federal Register</span> of notice of the physician-owned hospital&apos;s expansion exception request and a 30-day rebuttal period for the requesting hospital to respond, if it chooses, to any written comments that CMS receives from the community. Currently, an expansion exception request is considered complete at the end of the 30-day comment period if CMS does not receive written comments from the community. If CMS receives written comments from the community, the request is considered complete at the end of the 30-day rebuttal period, regardless of whether the requesting hospital submits a rebuttal statement.</p>
          <p id="p-2566" data-page="66995">In the proposed rule, we explained that permitting the use of non-HCRIS data in an expansion exception request would likely require additional time for our review of the request, including any comments submitted with respect to the request. Therefore, we proposed to revise our regulations at &#xA7; 411.362(c)(5) to extend the date by which certain expansion exception requests will be deemed complete. Specifically, we proposed to revise &#xA7; 411.362(c)(5) to provide that, where the request, any written comments, and any rebuttal statement include only HCRIS data, the current timeframes would apply. That is, such an expansion exception request would be deemed complete no later than: (1) The end of the 30-day comment period if no written comments from the community are received; and (2) the end of the 30-day rebuttal period if written comments from the community are received, regardless of whether the physician-owned hospital submitting the request submits a rebuttal statement. We also proposed that, where the request, any written comments, or a rebuttal statement includes data from a supplemental data source, an expansion exception request would be deemed complete no later than: (1) 180 days after the end of the 30-day comment period if no written comments from the community are received; and (2) 180 days after the end of the 30-day rebuttal period if written comments from the community are received, regardless of whether the physician-owned hospital submitting the request submits a rebuttal statement.</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Summary of Public Comments and Our Responses Regarding Community Input and Timing of a Complete Request</b></p>
          <p id="p-2567" data-page="66995">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Some commenters encouraged CMS not to finalize the actual notification requirement, stating that it would impose a burden (both procedural and financial) on the requesting hospital or could lead to an increase in comments regarding each request and the complexity of those comments. One commenter stated that requiring actual notification to other hospitals located in the same county as the requesting hospital goes beyond the intent of the Congress in enacting this provision of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
          <p id="p-2568" data-page="66995">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We believe that an actual notification requirement is important to ensure that comparison hospitals are aware of the opportunity to confirm or dispute the accuracy or reliability of the data in the physician-owned hospital&apos;s request, and that any burden on the requesting hospital is outweighed by the facilitation of robust community input that can help inform the Secretary&apos;s review of an expansion exception request. We believe that thorough vetting of all relevant information, both from the requesting hospital and the community in which the hospital is located, in fact, was the intent of the Congress. We disagree with the commenter that stated that this requirement goes beyond the congressional intent or our statutory authority.</p>
          <p id="p-2569" data-page="66995">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter opposed CMS&apos; proposal to deem an expansion exception request that relies on a non-HCRIS data source complete no later than 180 days after the end of the 30-day comment period if no written comments from the community are received, and 180 days after the end of the 30-day rebuttal period if written comments from the community are received, regardless of whether the physician-owned hospital submitting the request submits a rebuttal statement. The commenter stated that the additional time beyond the 30-day period provided for in our existing regulations is particularly unnecessary if the requesting hospital uses inpatient admissions data from a State Medicaid agency that shows the percentage of Medicaid admissions for all of the hospitals operating in the same county as the requesting hospital.</p>
          <p id="p-2570" data-page="66995">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The purpose of our proposed policy extending the timeframe for deeming complete an expansion exception request where the request itself, any community input, or any rebuttal statement includes non-HCRIS data is to provide CMS with sufficient time to address any potential conflicts between data presented by the requesting hospital and data or other information presented by a commenter or in the possession of CMS. As we noted in the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, the limitations on data sources that may be used in a physician-owned hospital&apos;s expansion exception request do not apply to members of the community or to CMS (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74522">76 FR 74522</a>). Therefore, it is possible (if not likely) that, when reviewing an expansion exception request, CMS would need to verify the data (and other information, if any) provided by the requesting hospital and any commenters, as well as consider the data in light of the information otherwise available to CMS. This review could involve the use of internal experts or contractors, which will require additional time. We note that the timeframe for deeming an expansion exception request complete will be &#x201C;no later than&#x201D; 180 days after the end of the 30-day comment period (if no written comments from the community are received) and 180 days after the end of the 30-day rebuttal period (if written comments from the community are received) does not preclude an earlier timeframe where the information submitted by the requesting hospital does not conflict with any community input or information otherwise available to CMS.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Final Provisions Regarding Community Input and Timing of a Complete Request</b></p>
          <p id="p-2571" data-page="66995">After consideration of the public comments we received on community input and timing of a complete response, we are finalizing our proposal, without modification, recognizing that, under this final rule with comment period, the only permissible supplemental data sources are external data sources, as defined in this final rule with comment period at &#xA7; 411.362.</p>

<h4><a name="319"></a>D. Additional Considerations</h4>


          <p id="p-2572" data-page="66995">We recognize the importance of an accurate and consistent expansion exception process. We stated in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41056">79 FR 41056</a>) that we are aware that data sources have unique characteristics due to their inputs, collection methods, compilation, and other factors, and that we would take this into consideration if we finalized our proposal to permit the use of supplemental data sources. In an effort to implement an accurate and consistent expansion exception process,<span id="page-66996" class="printed_page" data-page="66996"> </span>we solicited comments on the utility, appropriateness, and limitations of our proposal to permit the use of supplemental data sources. Specifically, we sought comments that:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-2573" data-page="66996"> Address whether permitting the use of supplemental internal or external data sources would significantly affect the outcomes for any of the estimates or determinations required in our regulations.</li>
          <li id="p-2574" data-page="66996"> Address whether permitting the use of supplemental data sources would materially affect a physician-owned hospital&apos;s ability to request an exception or CMS&apos; determination on an exception request.</li>
          <li id="p-2575" data-page="66996"> Describe the length of time that would be necessary to obtain or generate the required data from a specific data source.</li>
          <li id="p-2576" data-page="66996"> Address whether and when the data will be available and accessible per fiscal year.</li>
          <li id="p-2577" data-page="66996"> Address whether the data will be available and accessible in a format that enables the requesting hospital to perform the necessary comparisons.</li>
          <li id="p-2578" data-page="66996"> Describe how supplemental data sources could or should be prioritized, including, but not limited to, rankings related to accuracy or reliability.</li>
          <li id="p-2579" data-page="66996"> Describe how data from a particular data source could be used in the expansion exception process. We encouraged commenters to specify whether a particular data source already maintains the percentages or rates required, or whether calculations will be necessary to generate the required percentages or rates. If calculations will be necessary, we requested that commenters describe the calculations.</li>
          <li id="p-2580" data-page="66996"> Describe the cost to industry stakeholders, State governments, and the Federal government for obtaining or generating data from any potential data sources. We consider cost to include both resources (for example, human capital and information technology) and actual financial burden (for example, fees to use or purchase the data).</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-2581" data-page="66996">We also solicited comments on whether any additional burdens would affect the quality of care for beneficiaries as a result of additional costs borne by a requesting hospital.</p>
          <p id="p-2582" data-page="66996">We note that our inquiries were limited to solicitations of comments intended to inform our decision making regarding our actual proposals and, therefore, do not require a response in this final rule with comment period. However, we have chosen to summarize and respond to the comments that addressed ranking or prioritizing data sources and types of data because we believe discussion of these issues helps clarify how our revisions to the expansion exception process that we are finalizing will be implemented.</p>
          <p id="p-2583" data-page="66996">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters who addressed the additional considerations set forth in the proposed rule discussed ranking or prioritizing permitted data sources. One commenter recommended that CMS not prioritize or rank additional data sources, given that access to supplemental data sources will vary based on the hospital seeking the exception. Another commenter suggested that CMS give the highest priority to admissions data from State Medicaid agencies for the inpatient Medicaid admissions criteria. The commenter stated that the State in which the commenter is located provides an unbiased, reliable, single source of inpatient Medicaid admissions percentages that would eliminate the need for independent calculations by the requesting hospital and individuals and entities in the community in which the hospital is located. The commenter further suggested that if actual admissions data are unavailable through the State Medicaid agency, CMS permit the use of other data, including estimates of Medicaid admissions based on discharges using supplemental data.</p>
          <p id="p-2584" data-page="66996">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We share the concerns of the commenters that noted that the external data sources available to requesting hospitals will vary from State to State. We also believe that the quality and completeness of the external data sources available to requesting hospitals will vary in the same manner. We further note the complexity involved in making a generally applicable policy as to how to rank or prioritize various data sources. Therefore, we decline to provide guidance regarding the rank or prioritization of potentially available data sources for use in the expansion exception process. Our goal remains to ensure a fair, accurate, and consistent process to implement section 6001 of the Affordable Care Act. As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, each expansion exception request will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary will consider only reliable, credible information to determine whether a requesting physician-owned hospital qualifies for an exception to the facility expansion prohibition.</p>

<h4><a name="320"></a>E. Summary of the Final Provisions Regarding the Expansion Exception Process Under the Rural Provider and Hospital Ownership Exceptions to the Physician Self-Referral Law</h4>

          <p id="p-2585" data-page="66996">In this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing the following policies related to the expansion exception process for physician-owned hospitals:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-2586" data-page="66996"> We are permitting the use of external data sources to estimate a physician-owned hospital&apos;s annual percentage of inpatient admissions under Medicaid (&#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii)), the average percentage of inpatient admissions under Medicaid of all hospitals in the county in which a physician-owned hospital requesting an expansion exception as an &#x201C;applicable hospital&#x201D; is located (&#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii)), and the annual percentage of inpatient admissions under Medicaid of any other hospital in the county in which a physician-owned hospital requesting an expansion exception as a &#x201C;high Medicaid facility&#x201D; is located (&#xA7; 411.362(c)(3)(ii)). However, on or after such date that the Secretary determines that HCRIS contains sufficiently complete inpatient Medicaid discharge data, a hospital may use only filed Medicare hospital cost report data to estimate the percentages of inpatient Medicaid admissions referenced in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii).</li>

<h3>XVI. Revision of the Requirements for Physician Certification of Hospital Inpatient Services Other Than Psychiatric Inpatient Services </h3>


          <p id="p-2593" data-page="66997">In the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-27644">78 FR 27644</a> through 27650), we discussed the statutory requirement for certification of hospital inpatient services for payment under Medicare Part A. The certification requirement for inpatient services other than psychiatric inpatient services is found in section 1814(a)(3) of the Act, which provides that Medicare Part A payment will only be made for such services &#x201C;which are furnished over a period of time, [if] a physician certifies that such services are required to be given on an inpatient basis.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="p-2594" data-page="66997">As discussed in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41056">79 FR 41056</a> through 41058), in commenting on our FY 2014 proposal mentioned above, some commenters argued that the statutory reference to services furnished &#x201C;over a period of time&#x201D; and the then-existing regulation&apos;s lack of any specific deadline for physician certifications in nonoutlier cases indicated that no certification was required for short-stay cases. In support of their argument, the commenters cited the legislative history of section 1814(a)(3) of the Act, which these commenters interpreted as indicating that the certification requirements should apply only to certain long-term stays.</p>
          <p id="p-2595" data-page="66997">As we indicated in our response to these public comments in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-50939">78 FR 50939</a>), we do not agree with the assertion that the only possible interpretation of the statute is that the requirement for physician certification only applies to long-stay cases. The statute does not define &#x201C;over a period of time,&#x201D; and further provides that &#x201C;such certification shall be furnished only in such cases, and with such frequency, and accompanied by such supporting material . . . as may be provided by regulations.&#x201D; By this language, Congress explicitly delegated authority to the agency to elucidate this provision of the statute by regulation.</p>
          <p id="p-2596" data-page="66997">In our previous regulations, we interpreted the statute&apos;s requirement of a physician certification for inpatient hospital services furnished &#x201C;over a period of time&#x201D; to apply to all inpatient admissions. While this is not the only possible interpretation of the statute, we believe that it is a permissible interpretation.</p>
          <p id="p-2597" data-page="66997">We continue to believe that an order from a physician or other qualified practitioner in order to trigger an inpatient hospital admission as specified in <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-412.3">42 CFR 412.3</a> is necessary for all inpatient admissions. As described more fully in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-50938">78 FR 50938</a> through 50954), the requirement for a physician order for a hospital inpatient admission has long been clear in the Medicare hospital conditions of participation (CoPs), and we promulgated &#xA7; 412.3 to make more explicit that admission pursuant to this order is the means whereby a beneficiary becomes a hospital inpatient and, therefore, is required for payment of hospital inpatient services under Medicare Part A. A beneficiary becomes a hospital inpatient when admitted as such after a physician (or other qualified practitioner as provided in the regulations) orders inpatient admission in accordance with the CoPs, and Medicare pays under Part A for such an admission if the order is documented in the medical record. The order must be supported by objective medical information for purposes of the Part A payment determinations. Thus, the physician order must be present in the medical record and be supported by the physician admission and progress notes in order for the hospital to be paid for hospital inpatient services.</p>
          <p id="p-2598" data-page="66997">As further noted in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-50938">78 FR 50938</a> through 50954), we believe the additional certification requirements now specified under &#xA7; 424.13(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) (that is, the reason for hospitalization, the estimated time the patient will need to remain in the hospital, and the plan of posthospital care, if applicable) generally can be satisfied by elements routinely found in a patient&apos;s medical record, such as progress notes.</p>

          <p id="p-2599" data-page="66997">However, as we look to achieve our policy goals with the minimum administrative requirements necessary, and after considering previous public comments and our experience with our existing regulations, we believe that, in the majority of cases, the additional benefits (for example, as a program safeguard) of formally requiring a physician certification may not outweigh the associated administrative requirements placed on hospitals. Because we continue to believe that an inpatient admission order is necessary for all inpatient admissions, we proposed in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41057">79 FR 41057</a>) to require such orders as a condition of payment based upon our general rulemaking authority under section 1871 of the Act rather than as an element of the physician certification under section 1814(a)(3) of the Act. Section 1871 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to &#x201C;prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs under [Title XVIII].&#x201D; A clear regulatory definition of when and how a beneficiary becomes an inpatient is necessary to carry out the administration of Medicare Part A. Section 1861(b) of the Act defines &#x201C;inpatient hospital services&#x201D; as certain items and services furnished to &#x201C;an inpatient of a hospital,&#x201D; but does not define &#x201C;an inpatient of a hospital.&#x201D; Accordingly, &#xA7; 412.3 provides the necessary definition for purposes of Medicare Part A payment by clarifying when &#x201C;an individual is considered an inpatient of a hospital, including a critical access hospital.&#x201D; We proposed to remove paragraph (c) from &#xA7; 412.3. As<span id="page-66998" class="printed_page" data-page="66998"> </span>we proposed to rely on a different statutory authority for such regulation, we proposed that an admission order would no longer be a required component of physician certification of medical necessity.</p>
          <p id="p-2600" data-page="66998">As to the physician certification requirement, we maintain that our prior longstanding policy was based upon a permissible interpretation of section 1814(a)(3) of the Act pursuant to that provision&apos;s express delegation of authority to the agency to determine the circumstances under which such certification should be required. Nonetheless, after consideration of public feedback, our experience under the then-existing regulations, and our policy goals, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41057">79 FR 41057</a>), we proposed to change our interpretation of section 1814(a)(3) of the Act to require a physician certification only for long-stay cases and outlier cases.</p>
          <p id="p-2601" data-page="66998">As noted above, we believe that, in most cases, the admission order, medical record, and progress notes will contain sufficient information to support the medical necessity of an inpatient admission without a separate requirement of an additional, formal, physician certification. However, we believe that evidence of additional review and documentation by a treating physician beyond the admission order is necessary to substantiate the continued medical necessity of long or costly inpatient stays. While granting the Secretary broad discretion to determine the circumstances under which a physician certification should be required, the statute specifies that the certification by a physician with respect to inpatient hospital services (other than inpatient psychiatric hospital services) &#x201C;shall be furnished no later than the 20th day&#x201D; of the stay. Because the statute specifically requires that certification must occur no later than the 20th day, we believe that, at a minimum, Congress intended that physicians should conduct a more thorough review of such cases to help ensure that all requirements of medical necessity continue to be met. We also note the regulations at &#xA7; 424.13(f)(2) specify our longstanding requirement that the physician certification for cost outlier cases occur no later than 20 days into the hospital stay, and we did not propose to change the requirements for these cases. Therefore, we believe that, for nonoutlier cases, 20 days is also an appropriate minimum threshold for the physician certification, and we proposed to define long-stay cases as cases with stays of 20 days or longer.</p>
          <p id="p-2602" data-page="66998">Specifically, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41057">79 FR 41057</a>), we proposed to revise paragraph (a) of &#xA7; 424.13 to specify that Medicare Part A pays for inpatient hospital services (other than inpatient psychiatric facility services) for cases that are 20 inpatient days or more, or are outlier cases under subpart F of Part 412 of this chapter, only if a physician certifies or recertifies the following:</p>
          <p id="p-2603" data-page="66998">(1) The reasons for either&#x2014;</p>
          <p id="p-2604" data-page="66998">(i) Continued hospitalization of the patient for medical treatment or medically required diagnostic study; or (We note that, in setting out the corresponding regulation text for this provision in the proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41083">79 FR 41083</a>), we inadvertently omitted the word &#x201C;Continued&#x201D; at the beginning of this paragraph (a)(1)(i). We are making a conforming correction in this final rule with comment period. We do not believe that this conforming correction results in any substantive change in policy.)</p>
          <p id="p-2605" data-page="66998">(ii) Special or unusual services for cost outlier cases (under the prospective payment system set forth in subpart F of Part 412 of this chapter).</p>
          <p id="p-2606" data-page="66998">(2) The estimated time the patient will need to remain in the hospital.</p>
          <p id="p-2607" data-page="66998">(3) The plans for posthospital care, if appropriate.</p>
          <p id="p-2608" data-page="66998">We also proposed to revise paragraph (b) of &#xA7; 424.13 to specify that certifications for long-stay cases must be furnished no later than 20 days into the hospital stay.</p>
          <p id="p-2609" data-page="66998">Because the care furnished in inpatient psychiatric facilities is often purely custodial and therefore not covered under Medicare and because the primary purpose of the certification of these cases is to help ensure that Medicare pays only for services of the type appropriate for Medicare coverage, we did not propose changes to the certification requirements for inpatient psychiatric hospital services.</p>
          <p id="p-2610" data-page="66998">As discussed more fully in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-50942">78 FR 50942</a> through 50943), there also are inherent differences in the operation of and beneficiary admission to IRFs. Therefore, we also did not propose any changes to the admission requirements for IRFs.</p>
          <p id="p-2611" data-page="66998">We invited public comment on these proposals. Summaries of the public comments we received and our responses to those public comments are set forth below.</p>
          <p id="p-2612" data-page="66998">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Most commenters were supportive of the proposal to eliminate physician certification requirements for the majority of inpatient cases (other than long stay and cost outlier cases). Many commenters stated that the proposal would improve efficiency and would reduce the overall administrative burden on hospitals. Several commenters stated that the proposal would resolve ongoing issues within hospitals wherein certain practitioners routinely and appropriately admit patients, but are unable to complete the certification requirement because they do not meet the statutory definition of a physician. The commenters indicated that, because these cases rarely exceed 20 days, and do not typically exceed outlier thresholds, these practitioners would not be required to seek approval from a physician to complete a physician certification statement.</p>
          <p id="p-2613" data-page="66998">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We thank the commenters for their support of our proposal to apply certification requirements at &#xA7; 424.13 only to long-stay and outlier cases. We agree that our proposal would reduce administrative burden in general, and in particular would reduce the administrative burden associated with the majority of cases involving an admission order issued by a practitioner qualified to issue the order but who did not meet the statutory definition of a physician and therefore could not certify the case.</p>
          <p id="p-2614" data-page="66998">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters, while appreciative of the proposal to limit physician certification requirements, continued to disagree that CMS has the statutory authority to require signed admission orders for all inpatient cases. The commenters contended that CMS cannot use its general rulemaking authority under section 1871 of the Act to require a signed physician order for every inpatient admission. These commenters argued that that the continued requirement for admission orders is essentially the same as the certification requirement and stated that section 1814(a)(2) of the Act is explicit in requiring physician certification only for services &#x201C;furnished over a period of time&#x201D; and not for all services.</p>
          <p id="p-2615" data-page="66998">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We disagree with these commenters. While the inpatient admission order was a required component of the physician certification under our previous policy, the order and the physician certification do not serve identical policy goals under our proposal, which we are now finalizing. For all cases, a properly authorized and documented admission order is necessary because the admission order is integral to a clear regulatory definition of when and how a beneficiary becomes an inpatient. Such a definition is necessary to carry out the administration of Medicare Part A because, as noted previously, section 1861(b) of the Act defines &#x201C;inpatient hospital services&#x201D; as certain items and services furnished to &#x201C;an inpatient of a hospital,&#x201D; but does not define &#x201C;an<span id="page-66999" class="printed_page" data-page="66999"> </span>inpatient of a hospital.&#x201D; Accordingly, for all cases, our admission order requirements at &#xA7; 412.3 provide the necessary definition for purposes of Medicare Part A payment by clarifying when &#x201C;an individual is considered an inpatient of a hospital, including a critical access hospital.&#x201D; The development of admission order requirements is a necessary and appropriate use of our general rulemaking authority under section 1871 of the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-2616" data-page="66999">In most cases, the admission order, along with the medical record and progress notes, may also provide sufficient information to support the medical necessity of an inpatient admission without the separate requirement of an additional, formal, physician certification. However, for long or very costly inpatient stays, we believe that additional review and documentation by a treating physician are necessary to help substantiate the continued medical necessity of such stays, and a physician certification provides evidence of such additional review. The fact that we have determined, in the majority of cases, that the additional benefits (for example, as a program safeguard) of formally requiring a physician certification do not outweigh the associated administrative requirements placed on hospitals in no way changes the necessity and appropriateness of requiring a signed admission order for all cases.</p>
          <p id="p-2617" data-page="66999">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Some commenters requested that CMS require the admission order to be signed by the time of billing, not before discharge, as is permitted for CAH certification requirements. The commenters cited the administrative burden and logistical challenges involved with CMS&apos; requirements.</p>
          <p id="p-2618" data-page="66999">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We believe that, in most cases, matters relating to the determination of patient status should be resolved before discharge, due to the consequences that flow from such a determination. For example, whether services are billed under Medicare Part A or Part B can have a significant impact on a beneficiary&apos;s financial liability. Therefore, we do not believe it is appropriate to change our existing policy which requires that inpatient orders be signed prior to discharge by a practitioner familiar with the case and authorized by the hospital to admit inpatients.</p>
          <p id="p-2619" data-page="66999">In the FY 2015 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-50163">79 FR 50163</a> through 50165), we did finalize a provision to allow CAHs to complete certification requirements (including completion of the admission order) no later than 1 day before the date on which the claim for payment is submitted as they had been allowed to do prior to FY 2014. However, this policy exists in part to provide CAHs with greater flexibility in meeting certification requirements unique to CAHs. For example, CAHs face a statutory requirement that a physician certify that a patient will be expected to be transferred or discharged within 96 hours of admission. We do not believe it would be appropriate to apply this historical CAH policy more broadly to hospitals that do not face the same circumstances as CAHs.</p>
          <p id="p-2620" data-page="66999">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters requested that CMS provide additional guidance regarding the required content and format of the physician certification statement. Some commenters asked that CMS confirm that the policy requiring physician certification only for long-stay and outlier cases did not otherwise alter the inpatient hospital admission guidelines discussed in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-50944">78 FR 50944</a> through 50953). Others commenters requested general guidance and clarification regarding CMS policies in this area.</p>
          <p id="p-2621" data-page="66999">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As discussed previously in the section, the physician certification requirements at &#xA7; 424.13 generally may be satisfied by elements routinely found in a patient&apos;s medical record, such as progress notes. CMS does not require that a physician certification comply with a specific standard or format&#x2014;only that it ensures that the conditions at &#xA7; 424.13(a) were met. If the medical record adequately describes the reasons for continued hospitalization, the estimated time the patient is expected to require inpatient care, and discharge planning (where appropriate), and the medical record is signed by a physician involved with and responsible for the patient&apos;s care, this would satisfy certification requirements.</p>
          <p id="p-2622" data-page="66999">Our proposed policy change regarding the physician certification requirements does not change unrelated requirements implemented in the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule such as the requirements related to the 2-midnight policy. It also does not alter or remove any requirements for hospitals regarding admission orders.</p>
          <p id="p-2623" data-page="66999">We are committed to continuing to work closely with and provide outreach to stakeholders regarding inpatient admission policies and certification requirements.</p>
          <p id="p-2624" data-page="66999">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Some commenters requested that CMS provide guidance on how MACs will review cases in the interim time period between publication of this final rule and the effective date of the regulation changes (January 1, 2015).</p>
          <p id="p-2625" data-page="66999">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Since the effective date of the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we have worked closely with the MACs to ensure that the 2-midnight policy and related certification requirements are applied appropriately. As discussed previously, we believe that physician certification requirements for a high percentage of inpatient stays can be readily satisfied by elements routinely found in the medical record. Hospitals need to comply with all existing certification requirements until the finalized policy changes in this final rule with comment period go into effect on January 1, 2015. We are committed to continue to work with the MACs to prioritize medical review cases.</p>
          <p id="p-2626" data-page="66999">In summary, after consideration of the public comments we received, we continue to believe our certification proposal satisfies our policy goals while reducing the administrative burden on hospitals. Therefore, we are finalizing the policy as proposed in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, which limits the requirement for physician certification to long-stay (20 days or longer) and outlier cases. We are finalizing our proposed revisions of paragraph (a) of &#xA7; 424.13, with one minor modification. We are adding the word &#x201C;Continued&#x201D; at the beginning of paragraph (a)(1)(i), which we inadvertently omitted when we set out the regulation text in the proposed rule. We note that the preamble discussion in the proposed rule included this word (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41057">79 FR 41057</a>), as discussed earlier. We also are finalizing our proposed revision of paragraph (b) of &#xA7; 424.13, without modification, to specify that certifications for long-stay cases must be furnished no later than 20 days into the hospital stay.</p>

<h4><a name="323"></a>A. Background</h4>


          <p id="p-2627" data-page="66999">Medicare Part C and Part D payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations and Part D sponsors are determined, in part, using data submitted to CMS by the MA organizations and Part D sponsors. These &#x201C;payment data&#x201D; include diagnosis data that are used by CMS to risk adjust Part C and Part D payments, Prescription Drug Event (PDE) data that are used by CMS to cost reconcile various Part D subsidies, as well as other types of data discussed below. MA organizations and Part D sponsors are<span id="page-67000" class="printed_page" data-page="67000"> </span>obliged to submit accurate, complete, and truthful payment-related data, as described in regulations at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-422.504">42 CFR 422.504</a>(l) and 423.505(k). Through our review and oversight of payment data submitted by MA organizations and Part D sponsors, CMS identifies situations where MA organizations and/or Part D sponsors have submitted payment data to CMS that should not have been submitted either because the data submitted are inaccurate or because the data are inconsistent with Part C and Part D requirements. (Throughout this section, we refer to these data submissions as &#x201C;erroneous payment data.&#x201D;) If an MA organization or Part D sponsor submits erroneous payment data to CMS, the MA organization or Part D sponsor can address errors by submitting corrected data to CMS payment systems. Our approach thus far to these types of situations has been to request that MA organizations and Part D sponsors make these data corrections voluntarily.</p>
          <p id="p-2628" data-page="67000">However, in instances where the MA organization or Part D sponsor fails to make the requested data correction, the payment amount for the plan, calculated using that erroneous payment data, may also be incorrect. As a result, we have concluded that CMS needs to establish a formal process that allows us to recoup overpayments that result from the submission of erroneous payment data by an MA organization or Part D sponsor in the limited circumstances when the organization fails to correct those data. We emphasize that, in our experience, the circumstance where an MA organization or Part D sponsor fails to correct identified erroneous payment data arises very infrequently.</p>
          <p id="p-2629" data-page="67000">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41058">79 FR 41058</a> through 41063), we proposed a new process that is not intended to replace established recovery and appeals processes such as the Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit dispute and appeal process described at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-422.311">42 CFR 422.311</a> or the Part D payment appeals process described at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-423.350">42 CFR 423.350</a>. We stated that this proposed process would not constitute a change to the existing Part C or Part D payment methodologies. Rather, we merely proposed to adopt a procedural mechanism for recouping overpayments that CMS will use in those limited circumstances when an MA organization or Part D sponsor fails to correct erroneous payment data after notice and request from CMS to do so. The established recovery and appeals processes do not support this scenario. Section 1856(b) of the Act establishes authority for CMS to add standards for Part C and MA organizations. Section 1853 of the Act for Part C and sections 1860D-14 and 1860D-15 of the Act for Part D establish the methodology for computing payments to MA organizations and Part D sponsors, respectively. We believe that inherent in the methodology under which we calculate payments to MA organizations and Part D sponsors is the authority for CMS to establish a process for identifying and recouping overpayments in order to ensure that payments are made consistent with the payment framework established in the statute. Therefore, we proposed to implement such a process through changes to our regulations.</p>
          <br><p><b>1. Medicare Part C Payment Background</b></p>
          <p id="p-2630" data-page="67000">For Medicare Part C, CMS makes prospective monthly payments to MA organizations for each enrollee in the plan. CMS&apos; monthly Part C payment for each MA plan enrollee consists of two components: the capitated payment for each enrollee (calculated as the plan-specific county payment rate multiplied by the enrollee risk score), plus the plan rebate amount (if any). The plan-specific county rates and the plan rebate amount are based on the bid approved by CMS and are set in advance for a payment year. In addition, payment rates may be adjusted for enrollees with end-stage renal disease, enrollees in Medical Savings Account MA plans, and enrollees in religious fraternal benefit society MA plans under &#xA7; 422.304. Prospective payments are made during the year, subject to a reconciliation after the end of the year.</p>
          <p id="p-2631" data-page="67000">CMS adjusts the plan-specific county payment rate for each enrollee based on an enrollee risk score. Enrollee risk scores are determined using the CMS-Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) risk adjustment model in effect for the payment year, plan-submitted diagnoses for the data collection year, and other data that CMS determines to be appropriate to perform risk adjustment. The CMS-HCC model is prospective in that it uses diagnosis information from a base year (data collection year) to adjust payments for the next year (payment year or coverage year). For example, the risk adjustment model uses diagnosis data from 2013 to adjust payments to MA organizations for coverage in 2014.</p>
          <p id="p-2632" data-page="67000">To determine the appropriate risk score for each beneficiary, CMS uses demographic characteristics of beneficiaries and diagnostic information gathered in the administration of Original Medicare and submitted by MA organizations. MA organizations are currently required to submit an occurrence of an HCC model-relevant diagnosis only once during the data collection year, even though a beneficiary may have several service dates in a data collection year associated with a given diagnosis. The minimum data elements currently collected from MA organizations under &#xA7; 422.310 are: Health Insurance Claim (HIC) Number; provider type (hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or physician); service from date; service through date; and ICD-9 codes at the level of specificity used by the HCC model. In addition, effective January 2012, CMS collects more detailed Part C utilization and cost data from MA organizations (often referred to as encounter data), that will be used in setting risk scores.</p>
          <p id="p-2633" data-page="67000">CMS allows 13 months after the end of a data collection year for MA organizations to update the risk adjustment data submitted under &#xA7; 422.310; this period provides MA organizations an opportunity to identify and correct errors in data they have submitted for that data collection year (that is, by deleting diagnoses from CMS&apos; systems) and to identify and submit additional diagnoses not submitted during the data collection year. During this 13-month period, CMS uses the diagnosis data that MA organizations have submitted up to that point to calculate interim beneficiary risk scores for adjusting prospective payments made during the payment year. The end of this 13-month period is called the final risk adjustment data submission deadline (&#xA7; 422.310(g)(2)(ii)).</p>
          <p id="p-2634" data-page="67000">For each payment year, we apply three sets of risk scores to adjust payments: initial and midyear risk scores during the payment year (both sets are based on incomplete diagnosis data from the data collection year) and final risk scores after the payment year using data MA organizations submitted as of the final deadline for risk adjustment data (which reflect complete data for the data collection year). During the year, CMS makes monthly prospective payments to MA organizations based on enrollment information and using interim risk scores calculated based on the data available before the final risk adjustment data submission deadline. CMS calculates the preliminary risk scores before the first payment is made (that is, for January of the payment year) and again in the middle of the payment year; an interim reconciliation is made so that the prospective payments to MA organizations are based on the most recent risk score available for each enrollee.</p>

          <p id="p-2635" data-page="67000">After the final risk adjustment data submission deadline, CMS conducts a<span id="page-67001" class="printed_page" data-page="67001"> </span>reconciliation, in which the prospective Part C payments made during the coverage year based on interim risk scores are compared to Part C payments recalculated using final risk scores and the latest enrollment data. While changes in enrollment data are updated every month by CMS&apos; systems during the payment year (for example, disenrollments from MA organizations and dates of death from the Social Security Administration (SSA)), risk adjustment data are not finalized until the final risk adjustment data submission deadline.</p>
          <p id="p-2636" data-page="67001">We note that after the deadline for submission of final risk adjustment data, MA organizations are allowed to submit corrected diagnosis data to correct overpayments they received from CMS. However, after this deadline, MA organizations are not allowed to submit diagnosis codes for additional payment, as specified in &#xA7; 422.310(g)(2)(ii); this provision was recently adopted in the final rule entitled &#x201C;Medicare Program; Contract Year 2015 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs&#x201D; (<a href="/citation/79-FR-29843">79 FR 29843</a>). When such corrections are submitted, CMS conducts another reconciliation to correct the payments made to the MA organization using the established payment adjustment process. In addition, under &#xA7; 422.311, CMS conducts Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits of the risk adjustment data submitted by MA organizations pursuant to &#xA7; 422.310. Such RADV audits are conducted at the MA organization contract level and are designed to calculate a contract-level error rate and payment adjustment amount for a specific payment year under audit.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Medicare Part D Payment Background</b></p>
          <p id="p-2637" data-page="67001">For Medicare Part D, the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA), which amended the Act by adding Part D under Title 18, provides four payment mechanisms: direct subsidy (codified at &#xA7; 423.329(a)); reinsurance subsidy (codified at &#xA7; 423.329(c)); low-income subsidy (codified at &#xA7;&#xA7; 423.780 and 423.782); and risk sharing (codified at &#xA7; 423.336(b)). As a condition of payment, section 1860D-15(d)(2)(A) of the Act requires that Part D sponsors submit data and information necessary for CMS to carry out those payment provisions. Part D sponsors submit PDE data, direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) data and risk adjustment data to CMS for payment purposes.</p>
          <p id="p-2638" data-page="67001">Throughout the coverage year, CMS makes prospective payments to Part D sponsors that cover three subsidies: the direct subsidy; the low-income cost-sharing subsidy; and the reinsurance subsidy. The payment amounts are based on information in the approved basic bid and on data received by CMS that are used to update payments throughout the year. Following the end of the coverage year, the prospective payments are reconciled against the actual costs of the Part D sponsor. Reconciliation of the low-income cost-sharing subsidy and reinsurance and the calculation of risk sharing are based on PDE and DIR data submitted by the Part D sponsor, as well as data captured from other CMS systems. CMS instructs Part D sponsors that they should continually monitor their submitted data throughout the year in order to ensure that the reconciliation and final payment determinations are accurate.</p>

          <p id="p-2639" data-page="67001">The final Part D payment determination may be reopened and revised at CMS discretion under &#xA7; 423.346. In our final rule, &#x201C;Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit&#x201D; published in the <span class="E-04">Federal Register</span> on January 28, 2005 (<a href="/citation/70-FR-4194">70 FR 4194</a>), we stated that including the Medicare Part D reopening provision at &#xA7; 423.346 would &#x201C;ensure that the discovery of any overpayment or underpayments could be rectified&#x201D; (<a href="/citation/70-FR-4316">70 FR 4316</a>). However, this is only possible to the extent that the data submitted by Part D sponsors are accurate. Accordingly, prior to making a payment determination for a coverage year, either through a reconciliation described at &#xA7; 423.343 or a reopening described at &#xA7; 423.346, CMS periodically makes requests that Part D sponsors correct payment data that do not comply with program requirements (that is, what we have defined as &#x201C;erroneous payment data&#x201D;). These may be general requests to all Part D sponsors to look for a type of payment issue (see for example, the Health Plan Management System (HPMS) memorandum, &#x201C;Correcting Missing, Invalid, and Inactive Prescriber Identifiers on 2012 Prescription Drug Event (PDE) Records,&#x201D; dated February 4, 2013.) or targeted requests to specific Part D sponsors known to have particular payment issues (as was done in the &#x201C;Prescriber NPI Project&#x201D; announced in the HPMS memorandum, &#x201C;Announcement of Prescriber NPI Project and Web site Release,&#x201D; dated December 4, 2012). If a Part D sponsor fails to correct its payment data, the erroneous payment data remain in the payment system, rendering the reopening provision ineffective for rectifying overpayments as it was intended.</p>

<h4><a name="326"></a>B. Provisions of the Proposed Rule and Final Policies</h4>

          <p id="p-2640" data-page="67001">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41058">79 FR 41058</a> through 41063), we proposed to establish regulations at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-422.330">42 CFR 422.330</a>, relating to MA organizations, and at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-423.352">42 CFR 423.352</a>, relating to Part D sponsors, that would specify the procedural mechanism for CMS to recoup overpayments associated with data errors identified by CMS in payment data submitted by MA organizations and Part D sponsors. We also proposed to create a process whereby an MA organization or Part D sponsor can appeal the finding that payment data are erroneous.</p>
          <p id="p-2641" data-page="67001">We noted that our proposed policy is intended to establish a process to address data errors and payment adjustments that are not addressed by existing processes such as the RADV audit and appeal process or overpayments identified by the MA organization or Part D sponsor, which are subject to separate procedures. If an MA organization or a Part D sponsor self-identifies an overpayment, that overpayment must be reported and returned to CMS in accordance with section 1128J(d) of the Act, which was added by section 6402 of the Affordable Care Act. Regulations implementing section 1128J(d) have recently been adopted at &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.326 and 423.360 in the final rule entitled &#x201C;Medicare Program; Contract Year 2015 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs&#x201D; (<a href="/citation/79-FR-29843">79 FR 29843</a>).</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We appreciate the commenters&apos; support.</p>
          <p id="p-2644" data-page="67001">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters expressed concern about including Part C and Part D proposed provisions in the OPPS/ASC proposed rule. The commenters stated that these proposed provisions are unrelated to the OPPS and ASC payment systems.</p>
          <p id="p-2645" data-page="67001">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The Secretary generally has discretion to schedule and group topics for rulemaking, meaning any proposed and final rule published in the <span class="E-04">Federal Register</span>, as long as proper public notice is given that includes an explanation of the proposed policies, the rationale and basis for the proposal, and the public is given an opportunity to comment.</p>
          <p id="p-2646" data-page="67001">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters requested that CMS make clear that the proposal regarding CMS-identified overpayments has no relationship to other CMS overpayment regulations,<span id="page-67002" class="printed_page" data-page="67002"> </span>specifically the overpayment regulations that were promulgated to implement the requirements of section 6402 of the Affordable Care Act, codified at section 1128J(d) of the Act (<a href="/citation/79-FR-29847">79 FR 29847</a>). Commenters expressed concern that, given the connection between plan-identified overpayments and the False Claims Act, there is a potential for confusion and significant unintended consequences.</p>
          <p id="p-2647" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> In the preamble to the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we expressly limited the scope of our proposal to establishing a process to address data errors and payment adjustments that are not addressed by existing processes. We stated that overpayments identified by an MA organization or a Part D sponsor are subject to separate procedures and that if an MA organization or a Part D sponsor self-identifies an overpayment, the overpayment must be reported and returned to CMS in accordance with &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.326 and 423.360 of the regulations. We are further clarifying here that the CMS-identified overpayment process that is being finalized is separate and distinct from the overpayment rule that implemented the Affordable Care Act requirements regarding plan-identified overpayments codified at section 1128J(d) of the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-2648" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters provided comments on and questioned the provisions of &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.326 and 423.360 which relate to reporting and returning of overpayments identified by MA organizations and Part D sponsors, respectively.</p>
          <p id="p-2649" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We consider these public comments to be out of the scope of the provisions of the proposed rule. The proposed rule was limited to the issue of CMS-identified overpayments arising from the submission of erroneous payment data. Therefore, we are not addressing these comments in this final rule.</p>
          <p id="p-2650" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters stated that it is essential that CMS has overall control over the CMS-identified overpayment process to ensure proper identification and monitoring of overpayments. The commenters stated that this control is necessary to ensure that requests from separate CMS components or the Department&apos;s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for payment data changes are consistent with CMS-issued payment regulations and guidance. The commenters recommended that CMS provide adequate resources to the appropriate staff components in order to effectively coordinate and manage this process.</p>
          <p id="p-2651" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we stated that we may identify payment data that need to be corrected through a variety of different mechanisms, including, but not limited to, CMS analyses of payment data, audits, and/or communications with the MA organization or Medicare Part D sponsor. Regardless of how a potential overpayment is identified, CMS will conduct an independent evaluation of the erroneous data finding, before issuing a data correction notice to an MA organization or Part D sponsor. Although CMS may utilize OIG reports or other information to help to identify erroneous payment data, it is CMS, not the OIG, which will issue the request to correct payment data. Likewise, other separate CMS components may identify erroneous payment data, but it is the Medicare Part C and Part D payment components at CMS that will determine if that erroneous payment data could result in an overpayment and whether or not the CMS-identified overpayment process will be used to correct the overpayment. In addition, requests to correct payment data will only be issued after CMS has thoroughly reviewed the source or the mechanism that identified the payment data and has concurred with the findings that the payment data were erroneous.</p>
          <p id="p-2652" data-page="67002">We appreciate and agree with the commenters&apos; suggestion that the CMS administration should provide adequate resources to the payment staff in order to effectively coordinate and manage this process.</p>
          <p id="p-2653" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter asked CMS to clarify whether this regulation would be used as a means to collect any alleged improper payments identified through the Recovery Audit Contractors (RAC) process.</p>
          <p id="p-2654" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> As we indicated in the preamble of the proposed rule, this process is not intended to replace established recovery and appeals processes. We do not anticipate using this process to collect any overpayments identified through the RAC process at this time.</p>
          <p id="p-2655" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule does not address underpayments identified by CMS or the health plan. A few commenters suggested that CMS add language to the regulation to explain how health plans recover underpayments that they or CMS have identified. One commenter suggested that CMS offset identified underpayments against overpayments before recouping any overpayments.</p>
          <p id="p-2656" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The purpose of the proposed provisions is to recover overpayments identified by CMS and return them to the Medicare Trust Funds. The offset calculation used to determine the overpayments will follow the Medicare Part C and Part D payment rules, and, as a result, the offset calculation may capture some underpayments. The extent to which underpayments will be recognized in the offset calculation to net out an overpayment will be limited and will vary depending on the circumstance surrounding the overpayment. The purpose of the provisions is not to provide the opportunity for MA organizations and Part D sponsors to secure additional payment by submitting additional data after the data submission deadlines. As noted in the preamble of the proposed rule, MA organizations and Part D sponsors have a period of time after the end of the data collection and coverage years, respectively, to update and supplement the payment data submitted throughout the year. In Part C, that period is 13 months, and in the Part D context, it is approximately 6 months. We believe that these periods are adequate for MA organizations and Part D sponsors to ensure that they have submitted the data necessary to substantiate their payments.</p>
          <p id="p-2657" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter expressed concern that MA organizations&apos; or Part D sponsors&apos; benefit filings, current business dealings, and statutory rights and obligations may be affected if the plan&apos;s financial information is rendered uncertain due to an overpayment recovery by CMS.</p>
          <p id="p-2658" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> While we understand the commenter&apos;s concern that the possibility of returning overpayments may introduce some financial uncertainty for MA organizations and Part D sponsors, CMS has an obligation to ensure that payments to MA organizations and Part D sponsors are made consistent with the applicable program requirements. Thus, we believe that CMS has the authority to recover, and MA organizations and Part D sponsors have an obligation to return, identified overpayments.</p>
          <p id="p-2659" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters stated that overpayment recoupments from Part D sponsors may negatively impact beneficiaries. Commenters urged CMS to ensure that any adjustments made to recoup CMS overpayments from Part D sponsors continue to be appropriate to ensure that beneficiaries are not financially negatively impacted.</p>
          <p id="p-2660" data-page="67002">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We understand the commenters&apos; concerns that overpayment recoupments not negatively affect beneficiaries. However, CMS has previously issued regulations that address this issue. Section 423.466(a) of the regulations states that whenever a Part D sponsor receives information that<span id="page-67003" class="printed_page" data-page="67003"> </span>necessitates a retroactive claims adjustment, the Part D sponsor must process the adjustment and issue refunds or recovery notices within 45 days of the Part D sponsor&apos;s receipt of complete information regarding the claims adjustment. In addition, &#xA7; 423.466(b) states that Medicare Part D sponsors must coordinate benefits with State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SPAPs), other entities providing prescription drug coverage, beneficiaries, and other third party entities paying on the beneficiaries&apos; behalf for a period not to exceed 3 years from the date on which the prescription for a covered Part D drug was filled.</p>
          <p id="p-2661" data-page="67003">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters expressed concern about the burden imposed on providers. Commenters stated that the overpayment recovery process might cause financial consequences or penalties for physicians. Commenters expressed concern over the burden of related documentation requests. One commenter urged CMS to ensure that any associated provider record requests are limited to the specific instance of erroneous data under dispute. The commenter suggested that the plan requesting medical records be required to provide documentation on the scope of the erroneous data dispute identified by CMS and to limit the data request to the specific data issue identified.</p>
          <p id="p-2662" data-page="67003">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> These commenters appear to be focused on Part C and risk adjustment data. We recognize the commenters&apos; concerns that recoupment of overpayments may entail negative financial consequences for physicians. However, it is CMS&apos; responsibility to make payments to MA organizations and Part D sponsors that are consistent with the applicable statutes and regulations; this includes the authority to recover overpayments and return them to the Medicare Trust Funds. In addition, CMS is not allowed to interfere with the financial arrangements between MA organizations and their providers. Therefore, CMS is limited in how we can respond to the commenters&apos; concern. While we recognize there may be some burden relating to the request for documentation, it is important for the integrity of the payment process that overpayments are properly identified and documented.</p>
          <p id="p-2663" data-page="67003">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter suggested that any Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) remittances paid by the plan to CMS should be considered when computing the overpayment recovery amount. For example, if a plan had an MLR below the statutory minimum and paid an MLR remittance to CMS, and then, at a later date, it was determined that the plan was overpaid for that year, the remittance would reduce the overpayment recovery amount.</p>
          <p id="p-2664" data-page="67003">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> From a conceptual perspective, we believe that the impact or relationship between an MLR remittance and the overpayment offset amount is an issue about the payment calculation methodology and MLR administration, rather than a procedural issue. This regulation narrowly specifies a procedural mechanism for, first, recovering overpayments from MA organizations and Part D sponsors and, second, providing an appeals process related to the accuracy and correctness of the payment data underlying the offset. Therefore, we believe that these comments relating to MLR remittances are out of the scope of the provisions of the proposed rule.</p>
          <p id="p-2665" data-page="67003">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter expressed concern that there might be a large number of complications in situations where a contract has been terminated, or where there have been mergers or acquisitions involving the sponsor, or where other significant plan changes have occurred. The commenter requested guidance from CMS on the process in these situations. The commenter also asked that CMS be flexible in these scenarios.</p>
          <p id="p-2666" data-page="67003">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We hold entities contracting with CMS responsible for returning overpayments, regardless of their merger and acquisition history.</p>
          <p id="p-2667" data-page="67003">After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing the proposal to establish a process for recovering CMS-identified overpayments associated with erroneous payment data submitted by MA organizations and Part D sponsors.</p>
          <br><p><b>1. Definitions of &#x201C;Payment Data&#x201D; and &#x201C;Applicable Reconciliation Date&#x201D;</b></p>
          <p id="p-2668" data-page="67003">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41060">79 FR 41060</a>), we proposed to define &#x201C;payment data&#x201D; to mean data controlled and submitted to CMS by an MA organization or a Part D sponsor that is used for payment purposes (proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(a) and 423.352(a)). The MA organization or Part D sponsor is responsible for the accuracy of such data. MA organizations and Part D sponsors are currently required to attest to the accuracy, completeness, and truthfulness of such data under &#xA7; 422.504(l) and &#xA7; 423.505(k), respectively. For Medicare Part C, the data submitted by the MA organization to CMS include, for example, enrollment data and risk adjustment data specified at &#xA7; 422.310. For Medicare Part D, data submitted by the Part D sponsor to CMS include enrollment data and data submitted under &#xA7; 423.329(b)(3) (risk adjustment data), &#xA7; 423.336(c)(1) (cost data), &#xA7; 423.343 (data for retroactive adjustments and reconciliations), and data provided for purposes of supporting allowable reinsurance costs and allowable risk corridor costs as defined in &#xA7; 423.308, which include data submitted to CMS regarding direct or indirect remuneration (DIR).</p>
          <p id="p-2669" data-page="67003">There are additional payment-related data that CMS uses to calculate Part C and Part D payments that are submitted directly to CMS by other entities, such as SSA. These entities are the authoritative source for data that they submit to CMS, and MA organizations and Part D sponsors are not the official source for data submitted by these other entities. For example, the SSA is the authoritative source for date of death of Medicare beneficiaries. An MA organization or a Part D sponsor generally does not submit a beneficiary&apos;s date of death directly to CMS&apos; systems; such data come from the SSA data feed. When the SSA submits corrected data regarding a beneficiary&apos;s date of death to CMS, CMS&apos; systems recalculate the payments made to the plan for that beneficiary and correct any incorrect payment through a routine retroactive payment adjustment process. Therefore, we proposed to define &#x201C;payment data&#x201D; as only data that the MA organization or Part D sponsor controls and submits to CMS for payment purposes.</p>

          <p id="p-2670" data-page="67003">For MA organizations under Part C, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41060">79 FR 41060</a>), we proposed that the &#x201C;applicable reconciliation date&#x201D; occurs on the date of the annual final risk adjustment data submission deadline set under &#xA7; 422.310(g)(2)(ii). While changes in enrollment data are updated every month by CMS&apos; systems during the payment year (for example, disenrollments from MA organizations and dates of death from the SSA), risk adjustment data are not finalized until the final risk adjustment data submission deadline. Prior to that deadline, CMS allows the MA organization to continue submitting corrected and new diagnosis data. However, once the final risk adjustment data submission deadline has passed, CMS uses this final diagnosis data to calculate the final risk scores for the payment year. CMS then uses those final risk scores for payment reconciliation. By proposing that the applicable reconciliation date occurs on the risk adjustment data submission deadline, we intend to signal that the normal payment process for the year has been concluded.<span id="page-67004" class="printed_page" data-page="67004"> </span>

The annual deadline for submitting PDE data is the last Federal business day prior to June 30 of the year following the coverage year being reconciled. The annual deadline for submitting DIR data is announced annually through subregulatory guidance and generally occurs around the last business day in June of the year following the coverage year being reconciled. We selected these events to define the Part D applicable reconciliation date because data must be submitted by these deadlines in order to be used for the purposes of the final Part D payment reconciliation.</p>

Both the regulations regarding overpayments identified by MA organizations and Part D sponsors finalized earlier this year in the final rule entitled &#x201C;Medicare Program; Contract Year 2015 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs&#x201D; and the regulations we proposed in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule to establish offset and appeal procedures for CMS-identified overpayments were intended to address circumstances in which an overpayment has been identified; therefore, we believe it would be appropriate and avoid unnecessary confusion to use similar definitions.</p>

          <br><p><b>2. Request for Corrections of Payment Data</b></p>
          <p id="p-2680" data-page="67004">Because MA organizations and Part D sponsors are required to submit accurate payment data, we have the authority to request that erroneous data be corrected when errors are discovered. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41060">79 FR 41060</a>), we proposed a mechanism for recouping overpayments in situations where CMS has identified an error in payment data, the MA organization or Part D sponsor has not corrected that erroneous data upon request, and CMS determines that, as a result of the erroneous payment data, an overpayment was made. Under proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(b) and 423.352(b), we proposed that CMS would make the request through a data correction notice that would contain or make reference to the specific payment data identified by CMS as erroneous, the reason why CMS believes that the payment data are erroneous, and the timeframe in which the MA organization or Part D sponsor must make corrections to the data. This proposal was not intended to limit our authority to request correction of erroneous payment data to only those narrow circumstances in which an overpayment has already been identified. CMS may identify payment data that need to be corrected through a variety of different mechanisms, including, but not limited to, CMS analyses of payment data, CMS audits, or communications with the MA organization or Part D sponsor.</p>

          <p id="p-2681" data-page="67004">We understand that, at some point, it would no longer be practical for MA organizations and Part D sponsors to correct payment data for coverage years that have long since been reconciled. Therefore, consistent with the look-back period for overpayments that are<span id="page-67005" class="printed_page" data-page="67005"> </span>identified by the MA organization or Part D sponsor found at existing &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.326 and 423.360, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41060">79 FR 41060</a>), we proposed that CMS would request corrections to erroneous payment data only if the erroneous data affects payments for one or more of the 6 most recently completed payment years. That would mean, for example, that after the initial reconciliation takes place for Part D payments under &#xA7; 423.343 (that is, the determination of the final amount of direct subsidy described in &#xA7; 423.329(a)(1), final reinsurance payments described in &#xA7; 423.329(c), the final amount of the low-income subsidy described in &#xA7; 423.329(d), or final risk corridor payments as described in &#xA7; 423.336) for contract year 2015 (which would take place in 2016), CMS may request corrections to erroneous payment data for contract years 2010 through 2015. We proposed to use the same 6-year look-back period as applies to plan-identified overpayments under existing &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.326 and 423.360 because both overpayment policies are intended to address circumstances in which an overpayment has been identified, and we do not believe that the issue of which entity (CMS or the plan) identified the overpayment is relevant to the length of the look-back period.</p>
          <p id="p-2682" data-page="67005">We proposed that the timeframes for correcting payment data would be the same as under our current practice for correcting payment data described in existing procedural rules and subregulatory guidance and would be explained in additional procedural rules and subregulatory guidance, as necessary. For example, current Part D guidance states that corrections to PDE data must be completed within 90 days from discovery of the issue. We refer readers to the Health Plan Management System (HPMS) memorandum entitled &#x201C;Revision to Previous Guidance Titled `Timely Submission of Prescription Drug Event (PDE) Records and Resolution of Rejected PDEs,&apos;&#x201D; dated October 6, 2011.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We understand that correcting erroneous payment data submitted by an MA organization or a Part D sponsor and rerunning the payment process to determine the payment that should have been made may reflect an underpayment, overpayment, or no change when comparing the two results. Consistent with &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.504(l) and 423.505(k), MA organizations and Part D sponsors must submit accurate payment data (based on best knowledge, information, and belief). We clarify that CMS may make the request to correct erroneous payment data, regardless of whether or not that data would result in an overpayment under our existing and inherent authority related to administration of the payment processes; this rule does not change or limit that authority. Rather, this rule provides authority to initiate an offset to recover overpayments when erroneous payment data have been submitted, the erroneous payment data resulted in an overpayment, and the erroneous payment data were not subsequently corrected upon request from CMS. The intent of the provisions at &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330 and 423.352 is to provide a process whereby CMS-identified overpayments can be recovered; this process begins with CMS&apos; request for correction of the erroneous payment data that caused the overpayment to occur. We will establish the existence and extent of an overpayment by applying the Part C and Part D payment rules and formulas applicable to the payment year in question.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> This commenter&apos;s request appears to be directed at Part C and risk adjustment data. An overpayment may exist once applicable reconciliation has occurred, which is the final deadline for the submission of risk adjustment data for Part C. MA organizations should submit data corrections to correct an overpayment the MA organization has identified as soon as the MA organization recognizes the overpayment has occurred (&#xA7; 422.326). In the context of that rule and the process adopted under this rule, the operational action of conducting a risk adjustment payment rerun will be implemented according to our policy and schedules. The submission of data corrections should not be delayed relative to the timing of a risk adjustment rerun. If the data correction is not submitted, and we have identified the erroneous risk adjustment payment data, we may move forward with a payment offset. We agree that additional information on this issue would be helpful to MA organizations and will be providing further guidance as needed.</p>

However, if the MA organization or Part D sponsor fails to correct the erroneous payment data, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41061">79 FR 41061</a>), we proposed that CMS would conduct a payment offset from plan payments (proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(c) and 423.352(c)).</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Offset Amount</b></p>
          <p id="p-2701" data-page="67007">Because the data would not have been corrected in the routine payment process, in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41061">79 FR 41061</a> through 41062), we proposed, to be codified at &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(c) and 423.352(c), that CMS determine the overpayment offset amount by applying a payment calculation algorithm to simulate the payment calculations currently applied by CMS to produce the routine Part C and Part D payments. The payment calculation algorithm would apply the Part C or Part D payment rules for the applicable year to calculate what the correct payment should have been using corrected payment data. CMS currently simulates payment error amounts for a variety of different purposes, including for the annual Part C and Part D error rate reporting (required by the Improper Payment Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) and subject to the annual agency&apos;s Chief Financial Officer&apos;s (CFO) audit and reported in the annual Agency Financial Report (AFR)), RADV payment error estimation (subject to public comment), and the Part C and Part D monthly payment validation required by CFO auditors. These payment error calculations are all conducted outside of the suite of payment systems that CMS uses to make routine payments to MA organizations and Part D sponsors. In the proposed rule, we stated that we believe that these calculations are reliable and an accurate reflection of what the routine payment systems would calculate using the corrected data if the MA organization or Part D sponsor had submitted corrected payment data.</p>
          <p id="p-2702" data-page="67007">The actual process for calculating the overpayment will be different for Part C and Part D because of the different payment rules for the two programs. The Part C and Part D programs are both subject to risk adjustment payment error resulting from invalid diagnoses and to payment error due to inaccurate enrollment data. The Part D program is further subject to payment reconciliation error resulting from errors in PDE data and/or DIR data. The two programs also are subject to different schedules with regard to the applicable reconciliation date and subsequent payment reconciliation processes.</p>
          <p id="p-2703" data-page="67007">When new payment-related data are submitted to CMS payment systems, there is generally a change to the correct amount of payment once CMS conducts a payment reconciliation using the established payment adjustment process. However, it is not sufficient for the plan to just submit the new corrected risk adjustment, PDE, or DIR data to CMS systems because data submission does not automatically trigger a system reconciliation and payment adjustment. A change in payment will only occur if a payment reconciliation is conducted. If the applicable reconciliation has already been performed, CMS, at its discretion, may conduct risk adjustment reruns or Part D reopenings to ensure that payments also are corrected to reflect the newly corrected data.</p>
          <p id="p-2704" data-page="67007">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41061">79 FR 41061</a>), we proposed that, under the payment calculation algorithm, CMS would calculate the payment to the MA organization or Part D sponsor with and without the corrected data as of a specified date. The difference in the two amounts&#x2014;that is, the amount by which the payments already made to the MA organization or Part D sponsor exceed the payments that should have been made as reflected in the calculation using the corrected data&#x2014;would be the payment recovery or offset amount. We provided the following examples of how the offset amount would be calculated for Part C and Part D overpayments relative to two different types of payment data errors to illustrate our proposal:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-2705" data-page="67007">
<i class="E-03">Part C Offset Calculation.</i> The example for Part C relates to incorrect diagnosis data identified by CMS in the process of calculating the national payment error estimate. A beneficiary&apos;s final risk score and annual payment will be recalculated outside of the routine payment system without the invalid diagnoses but using all the other data used in the routine payment system. The year-appropriate CMS-HCC risk adjustment methodology will be used to produce the revised risk scores. The difference in payment for the beneficiary pre- and post-change in the invalid diagnosis will be the offset amount. This offset amount&#x2014;generated using the same process for each beneficiary for whom erroneous payment data are identified by CMS&#x2014;will be summed across all beneficiaries.</li>
          <li id="p-2706" data-page="67007">
<i class="E-03">Part D Offset Calculation.</i> The example for Part D relates to the situation in which a Part D plan sponsor has submitted PDE records for a beneficiary that include invalid National Drug Codes (NDCs). For payment purposes, PDEs are required to reference valid NDCs. In order to calculate the Part D payment offset amount, all of the beneficiary&apos;s entire post-reconciliation PDE data will be pulled, and the incorrect PDEs will be deleted or adjusted. The programmed calculation logic will keep track of a variety of payment-related information; for example, a beneficiary&apos;s benefit phase, gross covered drug cost, true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) costs, low-income cost-sharing subsidies (if any), and plan payment as the beneficiary progresses through the Part D coverage benefit. The calculation algorithm will tap into a variety of different data sets, such as health plan benefit parameters, beneficiary low-income subsidy status, and standard low-income cost-sharing subsidy parameters. Reports will then be produced on Gross Covered Drug Cost (GCDC) and low-income cost-sharing subsidy payment differentials. These payment differential amounts will be incorporated into final reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidy, and risk sharing summary totals for a contract. DIR adjustments will be factored into these calculations to arrive at the related payment offset amount to be applied at the contract level. The difference in reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidy, and risk sharing dollars with and without the correction to the PDEs will constitute the payment offset related to the beneficiaries with the incorrect PDEs.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-2707" data-page="67007">If the erroneous payment data in question is subsequently corrected through the CMS payment system, the offset amount will be reversed, and the payment to the MA organization or Part D sponsor will be updated through the routine payment process. However, if the data in the CMS system are not corrected and CMS conducts a reconciliation or reopening for the applicable payment year after the offset has been determined, the data will not be properly synchronized, and it is possible that the resulting payment adjustments could be incorrect. In order to resolve this problem, CMS may reverse the original offset and recalculate the offset using the more recent data used in the most recent payment reconciliation or reopening. The new offset amount will replace the previous offset amount, and CMS would need to evaluate and act on the resulting overpayment or underpayment.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> A few commenters expressed concern about the payment calculation algorithm that will be used to determine the overpayment amount that should be recouped. Other commenters stated that they could not understand why CMS cannot simply<span id="page-67008" class="printed_page" data-page="67008"> </span>correct the data in the payment systems of record and &#x201C;run a reopening.&#x201D; Commenters requested that CMS clarify why the traditional reopening process cannot adequately address the types of payment issues outlined in the proposed rule. The commenters noted that CMS has used its existing authority in the past to remove PDEs it believed should not have been submitted. One commenter stated that this proposal creates an environment where the sponsor&apos;s records of the PDEs and the TrOOP accumulators would be out of sync with CMS systems timing and would pose challenges during the reconciliations of PDEs and payment data, as well as readjudication of beneficiary claims, and as a result, recommended that CMS withdraw the proposal and assess whether there are other current less onerous mechanisms that can be adopted to better meet its goals.</p>
          <p id="p-2709" data-page="67008">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> For the Part C program and the Part D program, we believe that the traditional risk adjustment rerun and other reopening processes are the best mechanisms to recoup overpayments. We believe that these processes will be adequate to recoup overpayments in most cases because we assume that the majority of MA organizations and Part D sponsors will adjust their payment data upon request by CMS. However, as we stated in the preamble to our proposed rule, if an MA organization or Part D sponsor fails to correct erroneous payment data, the established risk adjustment rerun and reopening processes are inadequate. Because the data would not have been corrected in the CMS payment system, we will have to determine the overpayment amount by applying a payment calculation algorithm to simulate the payment calculations currently applied by CMS systems to produce routine Part C and Part D payments. It is true, as one commenter stated, that, in the Part D program, CMS has used existing authority to remove PDE data that should not have been submitted. We use that authority in very limited circumstances when the erroneous data is PDE data. Part D payment data also includes, however, direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) data, for which we do not have a means to &#x201C;correct&#x201D; erroneous data. Likewise, we do not have a process in place to &#x201C;correct&#x201D; erroneous data in the Part C program. In addition, because we only expect to conduct these types of data corrections in a limited set of circumstances, and it would require significant resources to make the payment system changes to support such corrections, CMS is prepared to use a more economical process based on running a payment calculation algorithm to recover the improper payments.</p>
          <p id="p-2710" data-page="67008">As stated in the proposed rule, CMS already simulates Part C and Part D payments outside of the core payment systems to accurately calculate payments and payment errors for a variety of different purposes. Therefore, we believe that this procedural mechanism is the least onerous mechanism that can be adopted to recoup overpayments, return them to the Medicare Trust Funds, and ensure that payments are made consistent with the payment framework established in statute. Therefore, we are not withdrawing the proposal, as one commenter recommended.</p>
          <p id="p-2711" data-page="67008">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter stated that CMS should not implement any type of extrapolation methodology when calculating the payment offset for MA organizations or Part D sponsors. The commenter believed that CMS may seek to extrapolate the results of erroneous payment data to all beneficiaries enrolled under a contract if the MA organization or Part D sponsor does not submit corrected data as requested by CMS. The commenter believed that the proposed provision could be interpreted to mean that CMS may apply the offset amount to all beneficiaries, even though not all beneficiaries may have been affected by the incorrect data. The commenter opined that it would not be appropriate to extrapolate payment-offset calculations without providing MA organizations and Part D sponsors with notice or an explanation of the methodologies that CMS would employ. Commenters recommended that CMS expressly state that extrapolation will not be involved in payment recoupment under the CMS-identified overpayment regulations, and the payment offsets should be applied based on payment errors that have been determined for specific beneficiaries.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> CMS may identify erroneous payment data submitted by MA organizations or Part D sponsors through a variety of different means. In the proposed rule, we discussed the procedures that CMS would undertake when erroneous payment data are identified, but did not address the means by which CMS would identify erroneous payment data. Therefore, this comment is outside the scope of the proposed rule.</p>
          <p id="p-2713" data-page="67008">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> Several commenters raised the issue that, in cases where a CMS-identified overpayment is a result of errors in diagnosis data submitted by MA organizations, CMS&apos; determination of the overpayment amount should take into account the fact that the CMS-HCC risk adjustment model used to risk-adjust payments to MA organizations is calibrated on diagnoses from Medicare fee-for-service claims not MA organizations&apos; claims. Commenters referred to this as the &#x201C;data inconsistency issue.&#x201D; Specifically, commenters noted that CMS has recognized, in the contract-level RADV context, that individual errors in risk adjustment data cannot be equated with overpayments without first accounting for the error rate in the fee-for-service (&#x201C;FFS&#x201D;) claims data. Commenters also stated that CMS has acknowledged when calculating overpayments based on medical record review for RADV audits that it must &#x201C;account for the fact that the documentation standard used in RADV audits to determine a contract&apos;s payment error (medical records) is different from the documentation standard used to develop the Part C risk-adjustment model (FFS claims).&#x201D; Further, commenters noted that, to address this problem, CMS implemented a &#x201C;FFS Adjuster&#x201D; that offsets the payment recovery amount to account for FFS and MA program differences in documentation standards. These commenters believed that CMS&apos; application of the &#x201C;FFS Adjuster&#x201D; in the RADV context does fulfill the actuarial equivalence requirement under the risk adjustment provisions in the Act, and failure to maintain logical consistency by applying this adjuster in the context of the CMS-identified overpayments addressed by this rule would be contrary to the actuarial standard in statute.</p>
          <p id="p-2714" data-page="67008">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We understand from these comments that commenters are specifically recommending that any risk adjustment payment recovery amounts be adjusted to reflect medical record coding documentation differentials between FFS providers and MA organizations. We note that this type of adjustment would not apply to other types of data errors, such as those that might be found in PDE data. We further interpret the commenters to be saying that the overpayment amounts should be adjusted downward to take the medical record coding documentation differential into account. From a conceptual perspective, we believe that the application of a FFS adjuster is a payment calculation methodology issue, rather than a procedural issue. Our proposal was narrowly tailored to specify a procedure for correcting the inaccurate data that MA organizations and Part D sponsors have submitted for payment and providing an appeals process. Therefore, we believe that these<span id="page-67009" class="printed_page" data-page="67009"> </span>comments relating to data inconsistency and the application of a FFS adjuster to overpayments are outside the scope of the proposed provision.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> The issue of whether or not payment data submitted by an MA organization or Part D sponsor are erroneous is a factual issue that is determined by looking at the payment data in relation to the payment framework established in statute and regulation, which the MA organizations and Part D sponsors agree to be contractually bound by when they sign the agreement with CMS to operate a Medicare Advantage and/or a Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. Under the clearly erroneous standard of review, the hearing officer will only overturn the reconsideration official&apos;s decision if that decision, based on the record before the reconsideration official, contains plain errors of fact or law. Because the determination of whether or not payment data submitted by an MA organization or Part D sponsor are erroneous is a factual one, we believe that the clearly erroneous standard is appropriate. The CMS reconsideration official reviews the underlying data that were submitted by the MA organization or Part D sponsor and any additional documentary evidence timely submitted by the MA organization or Part D sponsor, and thus is in the best position to determine the facts underlying the determination that erroneous payment data have been submitted.

If we determine that an overpayment has occurred, the MA organization or Part D sponsor must be able to provide evidence to refute the finding that the underlying payment data are erroneous in order to succeed on appeal. As stated in the proposed rule at &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(f) and 423.352(f), the MA organization or Part D sponsor must be able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that our finding that the payment data are erroneous was incorrect or otherwise inconsistent with applicable program requirements. Thus, we believe that it is reasonable to expect that MA organizations and Part D sponsors provide evidence to support how their payment data are correct and consistent with program requirements in order for the CMS hearing officer to reverse both an initial determination by CMS and a reconsideration decision by the CMS reconsideration official that erroneous payment data have been submitted.</p>

          <p id="p-2736" data-page="67010">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41062">79 FR 41062</a>), we proposed that the MA organization or Part D sponsor may request review of the hearing officer&apos;s decision by the Administrator within 30 days of issuance of the hearing officer&apos;s decision (proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(e)(3)(i) and 423.352(e)(3)(i)). The MA organization or Part D sponsor may provide written arguments to the Administrator for review. Under proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(e)(3)(ii) and 423.352(e)(3)(ii), after receiving the request for review, the Administrator would have the discretion to elect to review the hearing determination or decline to review it.

          <br><p><b>5. Matters Subject To Appeal and Burden of Proof</b></p>
          <p id="p-2738" data-page="67011">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41063">79 FR 41063</a>), at proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(f)(1) and (2) and 423.352(f)(1) and (2), we proposed to limit the subject-matter that an MA organization or Part D sponsor may appeal under this provision and establish the burden of proof that the MA organization or Part D sponsor must meet in its appeal. Under this provision, an MA organization or a Part D sponsor would be able to appeal the notice of payment offset solely on the grounds that CMS&apos; finding that the MA organization&apos;s or Part D sponsor&apos;s payment data were either erroneous or otherwise inconsistent with applicable program requirements. The MA organization or Part D sponsor would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in demonstrating that CMS&apos; finding was incorrect or inconsistent with applicable program requirements.</p>
          <p id="p-2739" data-page="67011">At proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(g) and 423.352(g), we proposed that the appeals process under paragraph (e) of these sections would apply only to payment offsets described at proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(c) and 423.352(c). It would not apply to any other CMS payment offset process.</p>
          <p id="p-2740" data-page="67011">
            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter noted that, in the proposed rule, CMS stated that the burden of proof is on the MA organization or Part D sponsor to prove that the CMS finding was &#x201C;incorrect or otherwise inconsistent with applicable program requirements.&#x201D; This commenter asked that CMS clarify that plans would not be expected to conform to FFS requirements or business models in coding practices. The commenter stated that in the past there have been occasions when CMS has relied on the use of FFS requirements or customary practices in the absence of specific MA or Part D guidelines. The commenter stated that this creates an unreasonable burden of regulations, rules, manuals, notices, and bulletins that must be considered in the process of identifying, reporting, and appealing matters of data accuracy and potential overpayment. In addition, the commenter believed that this practice does not address the fact that an error may have been solely caused by provider error, over which a plan has no control, and therefore places an unreasonable burden on the plan.</p>
          <p id="p-2741" data-page="67011">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We are not clear about the commenter&apos;s concern. In the preamble of the proposed rule, the phrase &#x201C;applicable program requirements&#x201D; is referring to MA program requirements, not to FFS program requirements. If the commenter is asking about coding practices, CMS does not provide specific MA guidelines on how to code, but instead requires that MA organizations use the code sets and guidelines in whatever version of the International Classification of Diseases that is in effect for the classification and reporting of diseases for all U.S. health care settings (not just Medicare). Further, we are unsure as to what the commenter is referring in the statement &#x201C;in the past there have been occasions when CMS has relied on the use of FFS requirements or customary practices in the absence of specific MA or Part D guidelines.&#x201D; The commenter did not provide any examples, so we are unable to respond to this concern. Regarding the statement that an MA organization has no control over provider errors in data submission, we refer readers to the contracting provisions in the MA regulation at &#xA7; 422.504 regarding the MA organization&apos;s responsibility for data submissions.</p>

          <p id="p-2743" data-page="67011">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41063">79 FR 41063</a>), we proposed that this new procedural mechanism for a payment offset at proposed &#xA7; 422.330 and &#xA7; 423.352 would apply after the effective date of any final rule implementing the new payment offset and appeals process, but that requests to correct payment data under proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(b) and 423.352(b) and the payment offsets under proposed &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(c) and 423.352(c) may apply to any payment year, subject to the 6-year limitation under &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(b) and 423.352(b).</p>
          <p id="p-2744" data-page="67011">We invited public comments on these proposals regarding the effective date and application of the rule.</p>

          <p id="p-2746" data-page="67011">In summary, we are finalizing the provisions at &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330 and 423.352, with the following modifications. We are removing the phrase &#x201C;controlled and&#x201D; from the definition of &#x201C;payment data&#x201D; at &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(a) and 423.352(a). We are adding the definition of &#x201C;erroneous payment data&#x201D; to the final regulation text at &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(a) and 423.352(a). At &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(b) and 423.352(b), we are moving language regarding the 6-year look-back period to &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(c)(1) and 423.352(c)(1) to indicate that if the MA organization or Part D sponsor fails to correct payment data, CMS will conduct a payment offset if the payment error identified affects payments for any of the 6 most recently completed payment years and the payment error for a particular payment year is identified after the applicable reconciliation date for that payment year. At &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(c) and 423.352(c), we are adding paragraph (2) to clarify that CMS will calculate the payment offset amount using the <i class="E-03">correct</i> payment data. In addition, we are making a minor modification to the regulation text at &#xA7; 422.330(d) and &#xA7; 423.352(d) to clarify that the payment offset notice will include at least the information outlined in the regulation, but may include other information relevant to the payment offset. Finally, we are revising &#xA7;&#xA7; 422.330(e)(2)(iii)(A) and 423.352(e)(2)(iii)(A) to state that we will provide written notice of the time and place of the informal hearing at least 30 days before the scheduled date.</p>

<h4><a name="342"></a>C. Associated Information Collections Not Specified in Regulatory Text</h4>

          <p id="p-2759" data-page="67012">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we made reference to proposed associated information collection requirements that were not discussed in the regulation text contained in the proposed rule. The following is a discussion of those requirements, any public comments we received, and our responses to those public comments.</p>
          <br><p><b>1. Hospital OQR Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-2760" data-page="67012">As we stated in section XIV. of the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, the Hospital OQR Program has been generally modeled after the quality data reporting program for the Hospital IQR Program (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74451">76 FR 74451</a>). We refer readers to the CY 2011 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/75-FR-72111">75 FR 72111</a> through 72114), the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74549">76 FR 74549</a> through 74554), the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68527">77 FR 68527</a> through 68532), and the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75170">78 FR 75170</a> through 75172) for detailed discussions of Hospital OQR Program information collection requirements we have previously finalized.</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Revisions to the CY 2016 Payment Determination Estimates</b></p>
          <p id="p-2761" data-page="67012">In the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75103">78 FR 75103</a>), we finalized the adoption of four new measures for the CY 2016 payment determination and subsequent years: (1) OP-27: Influenza Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel (NQF # 0431); (2) OP 29: Endoscopy/Polyp Surveillance: Appropriate Follow-up Interval for Normal Colonoscopy in Average Risk Patients (NQF # 0658); (3) OP 30: Endoscopy/Polyp Surveillance: Colonoscopy Interval for Patients with a History of Adenomatous Polyps&#x2014;Avoidance of Inappropriate Use (NQF # 0659); and (4) OP-31: Cataracts&#x2014;Improvement in Patient&apos;s Visual Function within 90 Days Following Cataract Surgery (NQF # 1536). In the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a>), we estimated measures OP-29, OP-30, and OP-31 would require 40 hours of reporting per quarter (96 cases &#xD7; 0.417 hours). We also estimated that reporting these measures via our Web-based tool would take 10 minutes (or 0.167 hours) per measure per year (or 2.5 minutes for each quarter&apos;s data, which are submitted on an annual basis) (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a> through 75172).</p>

          <p id="p-2762" data-page="67012">We noted in section XIII.D.2. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule and this final rule with comment period that we have delayed reporting for OP-29 and OP-30 for the CY 2016 payment determination by one quarter. Therefore, we estimate a reduction in burden of 40 hours for each of these measures (40 hours per quarter for reporting + 2.5 minutes of reporting via the Web-based tool) per hospital for the CY 2016 payment determination. In addition, in section XIII.D.3. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule and this final rule<span id="page-67013" class="printed_page" data-page="67013"> </span>with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to exclude OP-31 from the CY 2016 payment determination measure set. Therefore, we estimate that there will be no burden for reporting OP-31 for the CY 2016 payment determination, and an overall reduction in burden of 160 hours ((40 hours per quarter for reporting &#xD7; 4 quarters) + 0.167 hours per year for reporting via the Web-based tool) per hospital for the CY 2016 payment determination.</p>
          <p id="p-2763" data-page="67013">Combining the estimated reductions in burden for all three of these measures, we estimate a total reduction in burden of 240 hours (40 hours + 40 hours + 160 hours) per hospital for the CY 2016 payment determination due to delayed data collection for OP-29 and OP-30 and the exclusion of OP-31. We estimate that approximately 3,300 hospitals will participate in the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2016 payment determination. Therefore, we estimate a total reduction in burden of 792,000 hours (240 hours &#xD7; 3,300 hospitals) for the CY 2016 payment determination from our original estimate of 1.6 million hours (160 hours/measure &#xD7; 3 measures &#xD7; 3,300 hospitals) as discussed in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a> through 75172) for all hospitals participating in the Hospital OQR Program based on the data collection delays for OP-29 and OP-30 and the exclusion of OP-31. In the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a>), we estimated that these measures would result in a financial burden of $30 per hour. Therefore, we estimate that the changes to these three measures will result in a reduction in financial burden of $23.8 million ($30/hour &#xD7; 792,000 hours) for the CY 2016 payment determination from our original estimate of $76.8 million ($1.6 million &#xD7; $30) as discussed in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a> through 75172).</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Hospital OQR Program Requirements for the CY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years</b></p>
          <p id="p-2764" data-page="67013">As we stated in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a>), we believe there is a burden associated with successful participation in the Hospital OQR Program, where successful participation results in a full annual payment update (APU) for the particular payment determination. For the reasons stated in that rule, we believe that the burden associated with these requirements is 42 hours per hospital or 138,600 hours for all hospitals for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. We estimate a financial burden for these requirements of $4.2 million ($30/hour &#xD7; 138,600) for all hospitals.</p>
          <br><p><b>(1) Claims-Based Measures for the CY 2017 and CY 2018 Payment Determinations and Subsequent Years</b></p>
          <p id="p-2765" data-page="67013">We refer readers to the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68530">77 FR 68530</a>) for detailed discussions of the information collection requirements for the previously finalized claims-based measures (OP-8, OP-9, OP-10, OP-11, OP-13, OP-14, and OP-15). In section XIII.E. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to adopt one additional claims-based measure, OP-32: Facility Seven-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy, but are finalizing its inclusion in the measure set for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years instead of for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years as proposed. Before publicly reporting this measure, however, we will conduct a dry run (a preliminary analysis) for facilities to review their performance and provide feedback. For more detailed information about the dry run, we refer readers to our discussion in section XIII.E. of this final rule with comment period.</p>

          <br><p><b>(2) Chart-Abstracted Measures for the CY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years</b></p>
          <p id="p-2767" data-page="67013">We refer readers to the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/77-FR-68530">77 FR 68530</a> through 68531) and the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a>) for detailed discussions of the information collection requirements for the previously finalized chart-abstracted measures (OP-1, OP-2, OP-3, OP-4, OP-5, OP-6, OP-7, OP-18, OP-20, OP-21, OP-22, OP-23, OP-29, OP-30, and OP-31).</p>
          <p id="p-2768" data-page="67013">In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41034">79 FR 41034</a>), we proposed to remove three chart-abstracted measures from the Hospital OQR Program beginning with the CY 2017 payment determination, OP-4: Aspirin at Arrival (NQF # 0286); OP-6: Timing of Prophylactic Antibiotics; and OP-7: Perioperative Care: Prophylactic Antibiotic Selection for Surgical Patients (NQF # 0528). In section XIII.C.3. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to remove two of these measures (OP-6 and OP-7) from the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. We are not finalizing our proposal to remove OP-4 and refer readers to section XIII.C.3. of this final rule with comment period for a detailed discussion. We previously estimated that each participating hospital will spend 35 minutes (or 0.583 hours) per case to collect and submit the data required for the chart-abstracted measures finalized for the CY 2015 payment determination and subsequent years (OP-1, OP-2, OP-3, OP-4, OP-5, OP-6, OP 7, OP-18, OP-20, OP-21, OP-22, and OP-23) (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a>). Because we are finalizing our proposals to remove two of these measures, we believe that the time to chart-abstract measures will be reduced by 16.7 percent (2 of 12 measures) per case. Therefore, we estimate that hospitals will spend approximately 29 minutes (0.483 hours) per case to collect and submit these data.</p>
          <p id="p-2769" data-page="67013">Data submitted for the CY 2014 payment determination indicate that the average hospital will submit approximately 1,266 cases per year for these measures. Therefore, as a result of our removal of 2 chart-abstracted measures, we estimate that the time it will take for the average hospital to abstract data for all of the chart-abstracted measures will be 612 hours per year (1,266 cases &#xD7; 0.483 hours). We estimate that there will be approximately 3,300 hospitals that participate in the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. Therefore, we estimate that the chart-abstracted measures for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years will result in a burden of 2.02 million hours (612 hours &#xD7; 3,300 hospitals) for all participating hospitals, for a total financial burden of approximately $61 million (2.02 million hours &#xD7; $30/hour).</p>

          <p id="p-2770" data-page="67013">In addition, in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a>), we estimated that OP-29 and OP-30 would require 25 minutes (0.417 hours) per case per measure to chart-abstract. We also estimated that hospitals would abstract 384 cases per year for each of these measures. Our estimate for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years has not changed from last year&apos;s estimate (although, as noted above, we have changed our estimate for the CY 2016 payment determination based on the delay of reporting OP-29 and OP-30).<span id="page-67014" class="printed_page" data-page="67014"> </span>Therefore, for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years, we estimate a burden of 1.1 million hours (3,300 hospitals &#xD7; 0.417 hours/case &#xD7; 384 case/measure &#xD7; 2 measures) for all participating hospitals for OP-29 and OP-30 for a total financial burden of approximately $33 million ($30/hour &#xD7; 1.1 million hours).</p>
          <p id="p-2771" data-page="67014">In section XIII.D.3. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to exclude OP-31 from the CY 2016 payment determination measure set and, for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years, to change this measure from required to voluntary. Hospitals will not be subject to a payment reduction with respect to this measure for the CY 2016 payment determination or during the period of voluntary reporting. We continue to believe this measure addresses an important area of care, and anticipate that many facilities will report this measure on a voluntary basis. In the CY 2014 ASC/OPPS final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a>), we estimated that OP-31 would require 25 minutes (0.417 hours) per case to chart-abstract. We also estimated that hospitals would abstract 384 cases per year for this measure. We estimate that approximately 20 percent of hospitals (660 hospitals (3,300 hospitals &#xD7; 0.2)) will elect to report this measure on a voluntary basis. Therefore, we are revising the estimated burden for this measure to 105,685 hours (660 hospitals &#xD7; 0.417 hours/case &#xD7; 384 cases) for participating hospitals for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years, for a total financial burden of approximately $3.2 million ($30/hour &#xD7; 105,685 hours).</p>
          <p id="p-2772" data-page="67014">Therefore, for the chart-abstracted measures, we estimate a total burden for all participating hospitals of 3.23 million hours (2.02 million hours + 105,685 hours + 1.1 million hours) and $96.9 million (3.23 million hours &#xD7; $30/hour) for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <br><p><b>(3) Web-Based Measures Submitted Directly to CMS for the CY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years</b></p>
          <p id="p-2773" data-page="67014">We refer readers to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75171">78 FR 75171</a>) for detailed discussions of the information collection requirements for the previously finalized measures submitted via the Web-based tool. For the reasons stated in that final rule with comment period, we estimate that each participating hospital would spend 10 minutes per measure per year to collect and submit the data for the six measures (OP-12, OP-17, OP-25, OP-26, OP-29, and OP-30) submitted via the Web-based tool. Therefore, the estimated annual burden associated with these measures for all participating hospitals is 3,307 hours (3,300 hospitals &#xD7; 0.167 hours/measure &#xD7; 6 measures/hospital) for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <p id="p-2774" data-page="67014">As stated above, in section XIII.D.3. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal that hospitals have the option to voluntarily collect and submit OP-31 data beginning with the CY 2015 encounter period for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years; failing to report this measure will not affect hospitals&apos; payment determinations for CY 2017 and subsequent years. We continue to believe this measure addresses an important area of care and estimate that approximately 20 percent of hospitals or 660 hospitals (3,300 hospitals &#xD7; 0.2) will elect to report this measure on a voluntary basis. Therefore, we are revising the estimated burden for this measure for all participating hospitals to 111 hours (660 hospitals &#xD7; 0.167 hours) for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <p id="p-2775" data-page="67014">Moreover, we estimate that the financial burden incurred for the Web-based submission of these measures for all participating hospitals will be $119,070 ($30/hour &#xD7; (3,858 hours + 111 hours)) for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <br><p><b>(4) NHSN HAI Measure for the CY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years</b></p>
          <p id="p-2776" data-page="67014">We refer readers to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75172">78 FR 75172</a>) for detailed discussions of the information collection requirements for OP-27: Influenza Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel. In section XIII.D.1. of this final rule with comment period, we are clarifying the submission deadline for this measure. We do not believe there will be a change in burden due to this clarification because it was a typographical error and our previous estimates were based on the correct submission timeframe. We also noted that facilities should collect and submit a single vaccination count for each health care facility enrolled in NHSN by the facility OrgID. Although we believe an overall reduction in burden will occur because hospitals will only be required to submit this information once for both the Hospital IQR Program and the Hospital OQR Program, we do not believe there is a reduction in burden that is directly attributable to the Hospital OQR Program. That is, this requirement is independent of the Hospital IQR Program requirements. Therefore, our burden analysis remains the same. For the reasons discussed in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75172">78 FR 75172</a>), we estimate a total burden for all participating hospitals of 106,940 hours and a total financial burden of $3,208,203 associated with this measure.</p>
          <br><p><b>c. Review and Corrections Period Requirements for the CY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years</b></p>
          <p id="p-2777" data-page="67014">In section XIII.H.2.f. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to formalize that the time during which hospitals submit chart-abstracted data is the review and corrections period for those data. Because this proposal does not require hospitals to submit additional data, we do not believe it will increase burden for these hospitals.</p>
          <br><p><b>d. Hospital OQR Program Validation Requirements for the CY 2017 Payment Determination and Subsequent Years</b></p>

          <p id="p-2778" data-page="67014">In sections XIII.H.3.b. and XIII.H.3.e. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing three changes to our validation procedures: (1) A hospital will be eligible for random selection for validation if it submits at least 12 cases to the Hospital OQR Program Clinical Data Warehouse during the quarter containing the most recently available data (we note that this is a modification of our proposal that a hospital would be eligible for random selection for validation if it submitted 1 case); (2) hospitals will have the option to either submit paper copies of patient charts or securely transmit electronic versions of medical information for validation; and (3) hospitals must identify the medical records staff responsible for submission of records under the Hospital OQR Program to the designated CMS contractor. We do not believe that these changes to the eligibility requirements will result in additional burden because we will continue to select 500 hospitals for validation consistent with our previous burden estimates indicate (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75172">78 FR 75172</a>). In addition, we do not believe requiring hospitals to identify the medical records staff responsible for submission of records will result in additional burden since hospitals must already submit this information to our designated contractors (the State QIO), and only the contractor to whom the data is submitted may change. However, we do believe that the second requirement regarding the method of submission may result in a change in burden.<span id="page-67015" class="printed_page" data-page="67015"> </span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-2779" data-page="67015">We are finalizing our proposal that the requirement to submit patient charts for validation of Hospital OQR Program data may be met by employing either of the following options: (1) A hospital may submit paper medical records, the form in which we have historically requested them; or (2) a hospital may securely transmit electronic versions of medical information beginning in the CY 2017 payment determination and for subsequent years. We are finalizing our proposal that hospitals that choose to securely transmit electronic versions of medical information should either: (1) download or copy the digital image (that is., a PDF) of the patient chart onto an encrypted CD, DVD, or flash drive and ship the encrypted electronic media following instructions specified on the QualityNet Web site; or (2) securely submit PDFs of patient charts using a Secure File Transfer Portal on the QualityNet Web site. In the FY 2014 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/78-FR-50834">78 FR 50834</a> through 50835), the Hospital IQR Program previously finalized a similar policy that also allows hospitals to submit electronic versions of records for validation using the first method. In the FY 2015 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, the Hospital IQR Program finalized secure submission of digital images via a Secure File Transfer Portal (<a href="/citation/79-FR-50269">79 FR 50269</a>). For the same reasons outlined in the Hospital IQR Program (<a href="/citation/78-FR-50956">78 FR 50956</a>), we are finalizing our proposal to set a reimbursement rate of $3.00 per patient chart submitted electronically (using either of the finalized methods for electronic submission) for validation for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. We will continue to reimburse hospitals at a rate of 12 cents per page, plus shipping, for records provided on paper (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74577">76 FR 74577</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-2780" data-page="67015">The burden associated with validation is the time and effort necessary to submit validation data to the CMS contractor. For some hospitals, we believe that submitting these data electronically may result in a reduction in burden; for others we believe that submitting paper copies will be the least burdensome option. As we have previously stated in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we sample 500 hospitals for validation, and we estimate that it will take each hospital 12 hours to comply with the data submission requirements (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75172">78 FR 75172</a>). Therefore, because the number of hospitals we sample for validation will remain the same, we estimate a total burden of approximately 6,000 hours (500 hospitals x 12 hours/hospital) and a total financial impact of $180,000 ($30/hour x 6,000 hours) for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>

In section XIII.J. of this final rule with comment period, we note that we intend to make certain changes to the form to ensure that the form is consistent across CMS quality reporting programs.

In that final rule with comment period, we estimated that each participating ASC would spend 35 minutes per case to collect and submit the data for these measures, resulting in a total estimated burden for ASCs with a single case per ASC of 3,067 hours (5,260 ASCs &#xD7; 0.583 hours per case per ASC). We also stated that we expected ASCs would vary greatly as to the number of cases per ASC due to ASC specialization (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75173">78 FR 75173</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-2786" data-page="67015">As we stated in section XIV.E.3. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule and this final rule with comment period, we have delayed reporting for ASC-9 and ASC-10 for the CY 2016 payment determination by one quarter. Therefore, we estimate a 25-percent reduction in cases and burden for these measures for the CY 2016 payment determination. As we stated in section XIV.E.3.c. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule and this final rule with comment period, we delayed reporting of ASC-11 by 1 year. We also are finalizing our proposal to exclude ASC-11 from the CY 2016 payment determination measure set. As a result, we do not believe there would be any burden associated with this measure for the CY 2016 payment determination.</p>

The five previously adopted measures are: ASC-1: Patient Burn (NQF # 0263); ASC-2: Patient Fall (NQF # 0266); ASC-3: Wrong Site, Wrong Side, Wrong Patient, Wrong Procedure, Wrong Implant (NQF # 0267); ASC-4: Hospital Transfer/Admission (NQF # 0265); and ASC-5: Prophylactic Intravenous (IV) Antibiotic Timing (NQF # 0264). For the reasons we discussed in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75172">78 FR 75172</a> through 75173), we estimate that the reporting burden to report Quality Data Codes (QDCs) for these five claims-<span id="page-67016" class="printed_page" data-page="67016"> </span>based outcome measures would be nominal for the CY 2017 payment determination and for subsequent years.</p>

Before publicly reporting this measure, we plan to perform a dry run (a preliminary analysis) of the measure in 2015. We refer readers to section XIV.B.5 of this final rule with comment period for a detailed discussion of the dry run.</p>

          <p id="p-2795" data-page="67016">We refer readers to the FY 2013 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/77-FR-53642">77 FR 53642</a> through 53643) and the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75140">78 FR 75140</a>) for a complete discussion of our extraordinary circumstances extension or waiver process under the ASCQR Program. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we did not propose to make any substantive changes to this process. However, in the future, we will refer to the process as the extraordinary circumstances extensions or exemptions process. In section XIV.E.7. of this final rule with comment period, we note that we intend to make certain changes to the form to ensure that the form is consistent across CMS quality reporting programs. We do not anticipate that these minor changes would affect the burden estimates for this process.</p>

<h4><a name="362"></a>A. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking</h4>


          <p id="p-2798" data-page="67016">We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the <span class="E-04">Federal Register</span> and invite public comment on a proposed rule. The notice of proposed rulemaking includes a reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms and substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. This procedure can be waived, however, if an agency finds good cause that a notice-and-comment procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest and incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in the rule issued.</p>

          <p id="p-2799" data-page="67016">We utilize HCPCS codes for Medicare payment purposes. The HCPCS is a national coding system comprised of Level I codes (CPT codes) and Level II codes that are intended to provide uniformity to coding procedures,<span id="page-67017" class="printed_page" data-page="67017"> </span>services, and supplies across all types of medical providers and suppliers. CPT codes are copyrighted by the AMA and consist of several categories, including Category I codes which are 5-digit numeric codes, and Category III codes which are temporary codes to track emerging technology, services, and procedures. The AMA issues an annual update of the CPT code set each Fall, with January 1 as the effective date for implementing the updated CPT codes. The HCPCS, including both CPT codes and Level II codes, is similarly updated annually on a calendar year basis. Annual coding changes are not available to the public until the Fall immediately preceding the annual January update of the OPPS and the ASC payment system. Because of the timing of the release of these new codes, it is impracticable for us to provide prior notice and solicit comment on these codes and the payments assigned to them in advance of publication of the final rule that implements the OPPS and the ASC payment system. However, it is imperative that these coding changes be accounted for and recognized timely under the OPPS and the ASC payment system for payment because services represented by these codes will be provided to Medicare beneficiaries in hospital outpatient departments and ASCs during the calendar year in which they become effective. Moreover, regulations implementing the HIPAA (<a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-160">42 CFR Parts 160</a> and 162) require that the HCPCS be used to report health care services, including services paid under the OPPS and the ASC payment system. We assign interim payment amounts and status indicators to any new codes according to our assessment of the most appropriate APC based on clinical and resource homogeneity with other procedures and services in the APC. If we did not assign payment amounts to new codes on an interim basis, the alternative would be to not pay for these services during the initial calendar year in which the codes become effective. We believe it would be contrary to the public interest to delay establishment of payment amounts for these codes.</p>
          <p id="p-2800" data-page="67017">Therefore, we find good cause to waive the notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment of payment amounts for selected HCPCS codes identified with comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; in Addendum B and Addendum BB to this final rule with comment period. We are providing a 60-day public comment period.</p>

<h4><a name="365"></a>A. Regulatory Impact Analysis</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Introduction</b></p>
          <p id="p-2802" data-page="67017">We have examined the impacts of this final rule with comment period, as required by Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563</a> on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, 96), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (March 22, 1995, <a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=104&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=4&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub. L. 104-4</a>), <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13132">Executive Order 13132</a> on Federalism (August 4, 1999), and the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 (<a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=104&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=121&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub. L. 104-121</a>) (<a class="usc external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;amp;title=5&amp;amp;year=mostrecent&amp;amp;section=804&amp;amp;type=usc&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 804</a>(2)). This section of the final rule with comment period contains the impact and other economic analyses for the provisions that we are finalizing.</p>
          <p id="p-2803" data-page="67017">Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563</a> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This final rule with comment period has been designated as an economically significant rule under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and a major rule under the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 (<a class="publ external" href="http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;amp;congress=104&amp;amp;lawtype=public&amp;amp;lawnum=121&amp;amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub. L. 104-121</a>). Accordingly, this final rule with comment period has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. We have prepared a regulatory impact analysis that, to the best of our ability, presents the costs and benefits of this final rule with comment period. We solicited comments on the regulatory impact analysis in the proposed rule, and we address the public comments we received in this section below and in other sections of this final rule with comment period as appropriate.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Statement of Need</b></p>
          <p id="p-2804" data-page="67017">This final rule with comment period is necessary to update the Medicare hospital OPPS rates. It is necessary to make changes to the payment policies and rates for outpatient services furnished by hospitals and CMHCs in CY 2015. We are required under section 1833(t)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act to update annually the OPPS conversion factor used to determine the payment rates for APCs. We also are required under section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act to review, not less often than annually, and revise the groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments described in section 1833(t)(2) of the Act. We must review the clinical integrity of payment groups and relative payment weights at least annually. We are revising the APC relative payment weights using claims data for services furnished on and after January 1, 2013, through and including December 31, 2013 and processed through June 30, 2014, and updated cost report information.</p>
          <p id="p-2805" data-page="67017">This final rule with comment period also is necessary to update the ASC payment rates for CY 2015, enabling CMS to make changes to payment policies and payment rates for covered surgical procedures and covered ancillary services that are performed in an ASC in CY 2015. Because ASC payment rates are based on the OPPS relative payment weights for the majority of the procedures performed in ASCs, the ASC payment rates are updated annually to reflect annual changes to the OPPS relative payment weights. In addition, we are required under section 1833(i)(1) of the Act to review and update the list of surgical procedures that can be performed in an ASC not less frequently than every 2 years.</p>
          <br><p><b>3. Overall Impacts for the OPPS and ASC Payment Provisions</b></p>

          <p id="p-2806" data-page="67017">We estimate that the total increase in Federal government expenditures under the OPPS for CY 2015 compared to CY 2014 due to the changes in this final rule with comment period, will be approximately $900 million. Taking into account our estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix, we estimate that the OPPS expenditures for CY 2015 will be approximately $5.135 billion higher relative to expenditures in CY 2014. Because this final rule with comment period is economically significant as measured by the threshold of an additional $100 million in expenditures in one year, we have prepared this regulatory impact analysis that, to the best of our ability,<span id="page-67018" class="printed_page" data-page="67018"> </span>presents its costs and benefits. Table 49 displays the redistributional impact of the CY 2015 changes in OPPS payment to various groups of hospitals and for CMHCs.</p>
          <p id="p-2807" data-page="67018">We estimate that the update to the conversion factor and other adjustments (not including the effects of outlier payments, the pass-through estimates, and the application of the frontier State wage adjustment for CY 2015) will increase total OPPS payments by 2.2 percent in CY 2015. The changes to the APC weights, the changes to the wage indexes, the continuation of a payment adjustment for rural SCHs, including EACHs, and the payment adjustment for cancer hospitals will not increase OPPS payments because these changes to the OPPS are budget neutral. However, these updates will change the distribution of payments within the budget neutral system. We estimate that the total change in payments between CY 2014 and CY 2015, considering all payments, including changes in estimated total outlier payments, pass-through payments, and the application of the frontier State wage adjustment outside of budget neutrality, in addition to the application of the OPD fee schedule increase factor after all adjustments required by sections 1833(t)(3)(F), 1833(t)(3)(G), and 1833(t)(17) of the Act, will increase total estimated OPPS payments by 2.3 percent.</p>
          <p id="p-2808" data-page="67018">We estimate the total increase (from changes to the ASC provisions in this final rule with comment period as well as from enrollment, utilization, and case-mix changes) in Medicare expenditures under the ASC payment system for CY 2015 compared to CY 2014 to be approximately $236 million. Because the provisions for the ASC payment system are part of a final rule that is economically significant as measured by the $100 million threshold, we have prepared a regulatory impact analysis of the changes to the ASC payment system that, to the best of our ability, presents the costs and benefits of this portion of the final rule with comment period. Table 50 and Table 51 of this final rule with comment period display the redistributional impact of the CY 2015 changes on ASC payment, grouped by specialty area and then grouped by procedures with the greatest ASC expenditures, respectively.</p>
          <br><p><b>4. Detailed Economic Analyses</b></p>
          <br><p><b>a. Estimated Effects of OPPS Changes in This Final Rule With Comment Period</b></p>
          <br><p><b>(1) Limitations of Our Analysis</b></p>

          <p id="p-2809" data-page="67018">The distributional impacts presented here are the projected effects of the CY 2015 policy changes on various hospital groups. As we did for the proposed rule, we post on the CMS Web site our hospital-specific estimated payments for CY 2015 with the other supporting documentation for this final rule with comment period. To view the hospital-specific estimates, we refer readers to the CMS Web site at: <i class="E-03"><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html" class="external wrap">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/index.html</a>.</i> At the Web site, select &#x201C;regulations and notices&#x201D; from the left side of the page and then select &#x201C;CMS-1613-FC&#x201D; from the list of regulations and notices. The hospital-specific file layout and the hospital-specific file are listed with the other supporting documentation for this final rule with comment period. We show hospital-specific data only for hospitals whose claims were used for modeling the impacts shown in Table 49 below. We do not show hospital-specific impacts for hospitals whose claims we were unable to use. We refer readers to section II.A. of this final rule with comment period for a discussion of the hospitals whose claims we do not use for ratesetting and impact purposes.</p>
          <p id="p-2810" data-page="67018">We estimate the effects of the individual policy changes by estimating payments per service, while holding all other payment policies constant. We use the best data available, but do not attempt to predict behavioral responses to our policy changes. In addition, we do not make adjustments for future changes in variables such as service volume, service-mix, or number of encounters. In the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41068">79 FR 41068</a>), we solicited public comment and information about the anticipated effects of our proposed changes on providers and our methodology for estimating them. Any public comments that we received are addressed in the applicable sections of the final rule with comment period that discuss the specific policies.</p>
          <br><p><b>(2) Estimated Effects of OPPS Changes on Hospitals</b></p>
          <p id="p-2811" data-page="67018">Table 49 below shows the estimated impact of this final rule with comment period on hospitals. Historically, the first line of the impact table, which estimates the change in payments to all facilities, has always included cancer and children&apos;s hospitals, which are held harmless to their pre-BBA amount. We also include CMHCs in the first line that includes all providers. We now include a second line for all hospitals, excluding permanently held harmless hospitals and CMHCs.</p>
          <p id="p-2812" data-page="67018">We present separate impacts for CMHCs in Table 49, and we discuss them separately below, because CMHCs are paid only for partial hospitalization services under the OPPS and are a different provider type from hospitals. In CY 2015, we are continuing to pay CMHCs under APC 0172 (Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services) for CMHCs) and APC 0173 (Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services) for CMHCs), and we are paying hospitals for partial hospitalization services under APC 0175 (Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services) for hospital-based PHPs) and APC 0176 (Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services) for hospital-based PHPs).</p>
          <p id="p-2813" data-page="67018">The estimated increase in the total payments made under the OPPS is determined largely by the increase to the conversion factor under the statutory methodology. The distributional impacts presented do not include assumptions about changes in volume and service-mix. The conversion factor is updated annually by the OPD fee schedule increase factor as discussed in detail in section II.B. of this final rule with comment period. Section 1833(t)(3)(C)(iv) of the Act provides that the OPD fee schedule increase factor is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, which we refer to as the IPPS market basket percentage increase. The IPPS market basket percentage increase for FY 2015 is 2.9 percent (<a href="/citation/79-FR-49994">79 FR 49994</a>). Section 1833(t)(3)(F)(i) of the Act reduces that 2.9 percent by the multifactor productivity adjustment described in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(xi)(II) of the Act, which is 0.5 percentage point for FY 2015 (which is also the MFP adjustment for FY 2015 in the FY 2015 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-49994">79 FR 49994</a>)); and sections 1833(t)(3)(F)(ii) and 1833(t)(3)(G)(iv) of the Act further reduce the market basket percentage increase by 0.2 percentage point, resulting in the OPD fee schedule increase factor of 2.2 percent. We are using the OPD fee schedule increase factor of 2.2 percent in the calculation of the CY 2015 OPPS conversion factor. Section 10324 of the Affordable Care Act, as amended by HCERA, further authorized additional expenditures outside budget neutrality for hospitals in certain frontier States that have a wage index less than 1.00. The amounts attributable to this frontier State wage index adjustment are incorporated in the CY 2015 estimates in Table 49.</p>

          <p id="p-2814" data-page="67018">To illustrate the impact of the CY 2015 changes, our analysis begins with a baseline simulation model that uses the CY 2014 relative payment weights, the FY 2014 final IPPS wage indexes that include reclassifications, and the final CY 2014 conversion factor. Table<span id="page-67019" class="printed_page" data-page="67019"> </span>49 shows the estimated redistribution of the increase in payments for CY 2015 over CY 2014 payments to hospitals and CMHCs as a result of the following factors: The impact of the APC reconfiguration and recalibration changes between CY 2014 and CY 2015 (Column 2); the wage indexes and the provider adjustments (Column 3); the combined impact of all the changes described in the preceding columns plus the 2.2 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor update to the conversion factor (Column 4); the combined impact shown in Column 4 plus the CY 2015 frontier State wage index adjustment (Column 5); and the estimated impact taking into account all payments for CY 2015 relative to all payments for CY 2014, including the impact of changes in estimated outlier payments and changes to the pass-through payment estimate (Column 6).</p>
          <p id="p-2815" data-page="67019">We did not model an explicit budget neutrality adjustment for the rural adjustment for SCHs because we are finalizing our proposal to maintain the current adjustment percentage for CY 2015. Because the updates to the conversion factor (including the update of the OPD fee schedule increase factor), the estimated cost of the rural adjustment, and the estimated cost of projected pass-through payment for CY 2015 are applied uniformly across services, observed redistributions of payments in the impact table for hospitals largely depend on the mix of services furnished by a hospital (for example, how the APCs for the hospital&apos;s most frequently furnished services will change), and the impact of the wage index changes on the hospital. However, total payments made under this system and the extent to which this final rule with comment period will redistribute money during implementation also will depend on changes in volume, practice patterns, and the mix of services billed between CY 2014 and CY 2015 by various groups of hospitals, which CMS cannot forecast.</p>
          <p id="p-2816" data-page="67019">Overall, we estimate that the rates for CY 2015 will increase Medicare OPPS payments by an estimated 2.3 percent. Removing payments to cancer and children&apos;s hospitals because their payments are held harmless to the pre-OPPS ratio between payment and cost and removing payments to CMHCs results in an estimated 2.3 percent increase in Medicare payments to all other hospitals. These estimated payments will not significantly impact other providers.</p>
          <br><p><b>Column 1: Total Number of Hospitals</b></p>
          <p id="p-2817" data-page="67019">The first line in Column 1 in Table 49 shows the total number of facilities (4,006), including designated cancer and children&apos;s hospitals and CMHCs, for which we were able to use CY 2013 hospital outpatient and CMHC claims data to model CY 2014 and CY 2015 payments, by classes of hospitals, for CMHCs and for dedicated cancer hospitals. We excluded all hospitals and CMHCs for which we could not plausibly estimate CY 2014 or CY 2015 payment and entities that are not paid under the OPPS. The latter entities include CAHs, all-inclusive hospitals, and hospitals located in Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the State of Maryland. This process is discussed in greater detail in section II.A. of this final rule with comment period. At this time, we are unable to calculate a disproportionate share hospital (DSH) variable for hospitals not participating in the IPPS. Hospitals for which we do not have a DSH variable are grouped separately and generally include freestanding psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, and long-term care hospitals. We show the total number of OPPS hospitals (3,871), excluding the hold-harmless cancer and children&apos;s hospitals and CMHCs, on the second line of the table. We excluded cancer and children&apos;s hospitals because section 1833(t)(7)(D) of the Act permanently holds harmless cancer hospitals and children&apos;s hospitals to their &#x201C;pre-BBA amount&#x201D; as specified under the terms of the statute, and therefore, we removed them from our impact analyses. We show the isolated impact on 72 CMHCs at the bottom of the impact table and discuss that impact separately below.</p>
          <br><p><b>Column 2: APC Recalibration&#x2014;All Changes</b></p>
          <p id="p-2818" data-page="67019">Column 2 shows the estimated effect of APC recalibration. Column 2 also reflects any changes in multiple procedure discount patterns or conditional packaging that occur as a result of the changes in the relative magnitude of payment weights. As a result of APC recalibration, we estimate that urban hospitals will experience no change, with the impact ranging from an increase of 0.3 percent to a decrease of &#x2212;0.1 percent, depending on the number of beds. Rural hospitals will experience no change, with the impact ranging from an increase of 0.3 percent to a decrease of &#x2212;0.4 percent, depending on the number of beds. Major teaching hospitals will experience an increase of 0.7 percent overall.</p>
          <br><p><b>Column 3: New Wage Indexes and the Effect of the Provider Adjustments</b></p>
          <p id="p-2819" data-page="67019">Column 3 demonstrates the combined budget neutral impact of the APC recalibration; the updates for the wage indexes with the fiscal year (FY) 2015 IPPS post-reclassification wage indexes; and the rural adjustment. We modeled the independent effect of the budget neutrality adjustments and the OPD fee schedule increase factor by using the relative payment weights and wage indexes for each year, and using a CY 2014 conversion factor that included the OPD fee schedule increase and a budget neutrality adjustment for differences in wage indexes.</p>
          <p id="p-2820" data-page="67019">Column 3 reflects the independent effects of the updated wage indexes, including the application of budget neutrality for the rural floor policy on a nationwide basis. This column excludes the effects of the frontier State wage index adjustment, which is not budget neutral and is included in Column 5. We did not model a budget neutrality adjustment for the rural adjustment for SCHs because we are finalizing our proposal to continue the rural payment adjustment of 7.1 percent to rural SCHs for CY 2015, as described in section II.E. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <p id="p-2821" data-page="67019">We modeled the independent effect of updating the wage indexes by varying only the wage indexes, holding APC relative payment weights, service-mix, and the rural adjustment constant and using the CY 2015 scaled weights and a CY 2014 conversion factor that included a budget neutrality adjustment for the effect of changing the wage indexes between CY 2014 and CY 2015. The FY 2015 wage policy results in modest redistributions.</p>
          <p id="p-2822" data-page="67019">There is no difference in impact between the CY 2014 cancer hospital payment adjustment and the CY 2015 cancer hospital payment adjustment because we are finalizing our proposal to use the same payment-to-cost ratio target in CY 2015 as in CY 2014.</p>
          <br><p><b>Column 4: All Budget Neutrality Changes Combined With the Market Basket Update</b></p>

          <p id="p-2823" data-page="67019">Column 4 demonstrates the combined impact of all the changes previously described and the update to the conversion factor of 2.2 percent. Overall, these changes will increase payments to urban hospitals by 2.3 percent and to rural hospitals by 1.9 percent. Most classes of hospitals will receive an increase in line with the 2.2 percent overall increase after the update is applied to the budget neutrality adjustments.<span id="page-67020" class="printed_page" data-page="67020"> </span>

          <p id="p-2824" data-page="67020">This column shows the impact of all budget neutrality adjustments, application of the 2.2 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor, and the nonbudget-neutral impact of applying the CY 2015 frontier State wage adjustment. Rural hospitals in West North Central and Mountain States will experience estimated increases in payment of 3.4 and 4.2 percent, respectively, as a result of the frontier State wage index adjustment, while urban hospitals in those States will experience estimated increases of 3.2 and 2.5 percent, respectively.</p>
          <br><p><b>Column 6: All Changes for CY 2015</b></p>
          <p id="p-2825" data-page="67020">Column 6 depicts the full impact of the CY 2015 policies on each hospital group by including the effect of all of the changes for CY 2015 and comparing them to all estimated payments in CY 2014. Column 6 shows the combined budget neutral effects of Column 2 and 3; the OPD fee schedule increase; the impact of the frontier State wage index adjustment; the impact of estimated OPPS outlier payments as discussed in section II.G. of this final rule with comment period; the change in the Hospital OQR Program payment reduction for the small number of hospitals in our impact model that failed to meet the reporting requirements (discussed in section XIII. of this final rule with comment period); and the difference in total OPPS payments dedicated to transitional pass-through payments.</p>
          <p id="p-2826" data-page="67020">Of those hospitals that failed to meet the Hospital OQR Program reporting requirements for the full CY 2014 update (and assumed, for modeling purposes, to be the same number for CY 2015), we included 37 hospitals in our model because they had both CY 2013 claims data and recent cost report data. We estimate that the cumulative effect of all changes for CY 2015 will increase payments to all facilities by 2.3 percent for CY 2015. We modeled the independent effect of all changes in Column 6 using the final relative payment weights for CY 2014 and the relative payment weights for CY 2015. We used the final conversion factor for CY 2014 of $72.672 and the CY 2015 conversion factor of $74.144 discussed in section II.B. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <p id="p-2827" data-page="67020">Column 6 contains simulated outlier payments for each year. We used the 1-year charge inflation factor used in the FY 2015 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-50379">79 FR 50379</a>) of 5.09 percent (1.0509) to increase individual costs on the CY 2013 claims, and we used the most recent overall CCR in the July 2014 Outpatient Provider-Specific File (OPSF) to estimate outlier payments for CY 2014. Using the CY 2013 claims and a 5.09 percent charge inflation factor, we currently estimate that outlier payments for CY 2014, using a multiple threshold of 1.75 and a fixed-dollar threshold of $2,900 will be approximately 0.8 percent of total payments. The estimated current outlier payments of 0.8 percent are incorporated in the comparison in Column 6. We used the same set of claims and a charge inflation factor of 10.44 percent (1.1044) and the CCRs in the July 2014 OPSF, with an adjustment of 0.9821, to reflect relative changes in cost and charge inflation between CY 2013 and CY 2015, to model the CY 2015 outliers at 1.0 percent of estimated total payments using a multiple threshold of 1.75 and a fixed-dollar threshold of $2,775. The charge inflation and CCR inflation factors are discussed in detail in the FY 2015 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-50379">79 FR 50379</a> through 50380).</p>
          <p id="p-2828" data-page="67020">We estimate that the anticipated change in payment between CY 2014 and CY 2015 for the hospitals failing to meet the Hospital OQR Program requirements will be negligible. Overall, we estimate that facilities will experience an increase of 2.3 percent under this final rule with comment period in CY 2015 relative to total spending in CY 2014. This projected increase (shown in Column 6) of Table 49 reflects the 2.2 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor, less 0.13 percent for the change in the pass-through estimate between CY 2014 and CY 2015, plus 0.18 percent for the difference in estimated outlier payments between CY 2014 (0.82 percent) and CY 2015 (1.0 percent), less 0.1 percent due to the frontier State wage index adjustment in CY 2014, plus 0.1 percent due to the frontier State wage index adjustment in CY 2015. We estimate that the combined effect of all changes for CY 2015 will increase payments to urban hospitals by 2.3 percent.</p>
          <p id="p-2829" data-page="67020">Overall, we estimate that rural hospitals will experience a 1.9 percent increase as a result of the combined effects of all changes for CY 2015. We estimate that rural hospitals that bill less than 5,000 lines of OPPS services will experience a decrease of &#x2212;2.0 percent and rural hospitals that bill 11,000 or more lines of OPPS services will experience adjustments ranging from 0.9 to 2.1 percent.</p>
          <p id="p-2830" data-page="67020">Among hospitals by teaching status, we estimate that the impacts resulting from the combined effects of all changes will include an increase of 3.1 percent for major teaching hospitals and 2.0 percent for nonteaching hospitals. Minor teaching hospitals will experience an estimated increase of 2.0 percent.</p>
          <p id="p-2831" data-page="67020">In our analysis, we also have categorized hospitals by type of ownership. Based on this analysis, we estimate that voluntary hospitals will experience an increase of 2.4 percent, proprietary hospitals will experience an increase of 1.7 percent, and governmental hospitals will experience an increase of 2.1 percent.</p>

          <br><p><b>(3) Estimated Effects of OPPS Changes on CMHCs</b></p>
          <p id="p-2832" data-page="67022">The last line of Table 49 demonstrates the isolated impact on CMHCs, which furnish only partial hospitalization services under the OPPS. In CY 2014, CMHCs are paid under two APCs for these services: APC 0172 (Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services) for CMHCs) and APC 0173 (Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services) for CMHCs). Hospitals are paid for partial hospitalization services under APC 0175 (Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services) for hospital-based PHPs) and APC 0176 (Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services) for hospital-based PHPs). We use our standard ratesetting methodology to derive the payment rates for each APC based on the cost data derived from claims and cost data for the provider-type-specific APC. For CY 2015, we are finalizing our proposal to continue the provider-type-specific APC structure that we adopted in CY 2011. We modeled the impact of this APC policy assuming that CMHCs will continue to provide the same number of days of PHP care, with each day having either 3 services or 4 or more services, as seen in the CY 2013 claims data used for this final rule with comment period. We excluded days with 1 or 2 services because our policy only pays a per diem rate for partial hospitalization when 3 or more qualifying services are provided to the beneficiary. We estimate that CMHCs will experience an overall 1.3 percent increase in payments from CY 2014 (shown in Column 6).</p>
          <p id="p-2833" data-page="67022">Column 3 shows that the estimated impact of adopting the FY 2015 wage index values will result in a small decrease of &#x2212;0.5 percent to CMHCs. We note that all providers paid under the OPPS, including CMHCs, will receive a 2.2 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor. Column 4 shows that combining this OPD fee schedule increase factor, along with changes in APC policy for CY 2015 and the FY 2015 wage index updates, will result in an estimated increase of 1.7 percent. Column 5 shows that adding the frontier State wage index adjustment will result in no change to the cumulative 1.7 percent increase. Column 6 shows that adding the changes in outlier and pass-though payments will result in a &#x2212;0.4 percent decrease in payment for CMHCs, for a total increase of 1.3 percent. This reflects all changes to CMHCs for CY 2015.</p>
          <br><p><b>(4) Estimated Effect of OPPS Changes on Beneficiaries</b></p>
          <p id="p-2834" data-page="67022">For services for which the beneficiary pays a copayment of 20 percent of the payment rate, the beneficiary share of payment will increase for services for which the OPPS payments will rise and will decrease for services for which the OPPS payments will fall. For further discussion on the calculation of the national unadjusted copayments and minimum unadjusted copayments, we refer readers to section II.I. of this final rule with comment period. In all cases, section 1833(t)(8)(C)(i) of the Act limits beneficiary liability for copayment for a procedure performed in a year to the hospital inpatient deductible for the applicable year.</p>
          <p id="p-2835" data-page="67022">We estimate that the aggregate beneficiary coinsurance percentage will be 20.0 percent for all services paid under the OPPS in CY 2015. The estimated aggregate beneficiary coinsurance reflects general system adjustments, including recalibration of the APC relative payment weights, change in the portion of OPPS payments dedicated to pass-through payments, and the CY 2015 comprehensive APC payment policy discussed in section II.A.2.e. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>(5) Estimated Effects of OPPS Changes on Other Providers</b></p>
          <p id="p-2836" data-page="67022">The relative payment weights and payment amounts established under the OPPS affect the payments made to ASCs as discussed in section XII. of this final rule with comment period. No types of providers or suppliers other than hospitals, CMHCs and ASCs will be affected by the proposed changes in this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>(6) Estimated Effects of OPPS Changes on the Medicare and Medicaid Programs</b></p>

          <p id="p-2837" data-page="67022">The effect on the Medicare program is expected to be $900 million in additional program payments for OPPS<span id="page-67023" class="printed_page" data-page="67023"> </span>services furnished in CY 2015. The effect on the Medicaid program is expected to be limited to increased copayments that Medicaid may make on behalf of Medicaid recipients who are also Medicare beneficiaries. We refer readers to our discussion of the impact on beneficiaries in section XXI.A. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>(7) Alternative OPPS Policies Considered</b></p>
          <p id="p-2838" data-page="67023">Alternatives to the OPPS changes we proposed and are finalizing and the reasons for our selected alternatives are discussed throughout this final rule with comment period. In this section, we discuss some of the major issues and the alternatives considered.</p>
          
          <ul class="bullets"><li id="p-2839" data-page="67023"> Alternatives Considered for the Establishment of Comprehensive APCs</li></ul>
          
          <p id="p-2840" data-page="67023">We refer readers to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-74861">78 FR 74861</a> through 74910 and 75184 through 75185) for a discussion of our policy to establish comprehensive APCs for CY 2015 and the alternatives we considered. We note that we published tables in that final rule with comment period to demonstrate how this policy would have been implemented in CY 2014, and stated that we would be considering any additional public comments we receive when we update the policy for CY 2015 to account for changes that may occur in the CY 2013 claims data.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Estimated Effects of CY 2015 ASC Payment System Policies</b></p>
          <p id="p-2841" data-page="67023">Most ASC payment rates are calculated by multiplying the ASC conversion factor by the ASC relative payment weight. As discussed fully in section XII. of this final rule with comment period, we are setting the CY 2015 ASC relative payment weights by scaling the CY 2015 OPPS relative payment weights by the ASC scaler of 0.9225. The estimated effects of the updated relative payment weights on payment rates are varied and are reflected in the estimated payments displayed in Tables 50 and 51 below.</p>
          <p id="p-2842" data-page="67023">Beginning in CY 2011, section 3401 of the Affordable Care Act requires that the annual update to the ASC payment system (which currently is the CPI-U) after application of any quality reporting reduction be reduced by a productivity adjustment. The Affordable Care Act defines the productivity adjustment to be equal to the 10-year moving average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multifactor productivity (MFP) (as projected by the Secretary for the 10-year period ending with the applicable fiscal year, year, cost reporting period, or other annual period). For ASCs that fail to meet their quality reporting requirements, the CY 2015 payment determinations will be based on the application of a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the annual update factor, which currently is the CPI-U. We calculated the CY 2015 ASC conversion factor by adjusting the CY 2014 ASC conversion factor by 0.9998 to account for changes in the pre-floor and pre-reclassified hospital wage indexes between CY 2014 and CY 2015 and by applying the CY 2015 MFP-adjusted CPI-U update factor of 1.4 percent (projected CPI-U update of 1.9 percent minus a projected productivity adjustment of 0.5 percentage point). The CY 2015 ASC conversion factor is $44.071.</p>
          <br><p><b>(1) Limitations of Our Analysis</b></p>
          <p id="p-2843" data-page="67023">Presented here are the projected effects of the changes for CY 2015 on Medicare payment to ASCs. A key limitation of our analysis is our inability to predict changes in ASC service-mix between CY 2013 and CY 2015 with precision. We believe that the net effect on Medicare expenditures resulting from the CY 2015 changes will be small in the aggregate for all ASCs. However, such changes may have differential effects across surgical specialty groups as ASCs continue to adjust to the payment rates based on the policies of the revised ASC payment system. We are unable to accurately project such changes at a disaggregated level. Clearly, individual ASCs will experience changes in payment that differ from the aggregated estimated impacts presented below.</p>
          <br><p><b>(2) Estimated Effects of ASC Payment System Policies on ASCs</b></p>
          <p id="p-2844" data-page="67023">Some ASCs are multispecialty facilities that perform the gamut of surgical procedures from excision of lesions to hernia repair to cataract extraction; others focus on a single specialty and perform only a limited range of surgical procedures, such as eye, digestive system, or orthopedic procedures. The combined effect on an individual ASC of the update to the CY 2015 payments will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix of services the ASC provides, the volume of specific services provided by the ASC, the percentage of its patients who are Medicare beneficiaries, and the extent to which an ASC provides different services in the coming year. The following discussion presents tables that display estimates of the impact of the CY 2015 updates to the ASC payment system on Medicare payments to ASCs, assuming the same mix of services as reflected in our CY 2013 claims data. Table 50 depicts the estimated aggregate percent change in payment by surgical specialty or ancillary items and services group by comparing estimated CY 2014 payments to estimated CY 2015 payments and Table 51 shows a comparison of estimated CY 2014 payments to estimated CY 2015 payments for procedures that we estimate will receive the most Medicare payment in CY 2014.</p>
          <p id="p-2845" data-page="67023">Table 50 shows the estimated effects on aggregate Medicare payments under the ASC payment system by surgical specialty or ancillary items and services group. We have aggregated the surgical HCPCS codes by specialty group, grouped all HCPCS codes for covered ancillary items and services into a single group, and then estimated the effect on aggregated payment for surgical specialty and ancillary items and services groups. The groups are sorted for display in descending order by estimated Medicare program payment to ASCs. The following is an explanation of the information presented in Table 50.</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-2846" data-page="67023"> Column 1&#x2014;Surgical Specialty or Ancillary Items and Services Group indicates the surgical specialty into which ASC procedures are grouped and the ancillary items and services group which includes all HCPCS codes for covered ancillary items and services. To group surgical procedures by surgical specialty, we used the CPT code range definitions and Level II HCPCS codes and Category III CPT codes as appropriate, to account for all surgical procedures to which the Medicare program payments are attributed.</li>
          <li id="p-2847" data-page="67023"> Column 2&#x2014;Estimated CY 2014 ASC Payments were calculated using CY 2013 ASC utilization (the most recent full year of ASC utilization) and CY 2014 ASC payment rates. The surgical specialty and ancillary items and services groups are displayed in descending order based on estimated CY 2014 ASC payments.</li>
          <li id="p-2848" data-page="67023"> Column 3&#x2014;Estimated CY 2015 Percent Change is the aggregate percentage increase or decrease in Medicare program payment to ASCs for each surgical specialty or ancillary items and services group that are attributable to updates to ASC payment rates for CY 2015 compared to CY 2014.</li>
</ul>

          <p id="p-2849" data-page="67023">As seen in Table 50, for the six specialty groups that account for the most ASC utilization and spending, we estimate that the update to ASC rates for CY 2015 will result in a 1-percent decrease in aggregate payment amounts for eye and ocular adnexa procedures, a 6-percent increase in aggregate payment<span id="page-67024" class="printed_page" data-page="67024"> </span>amounts for digestive system procedures, a 1-percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for nervous system procedures, a 2-percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for musculoskeletal system procedures, a 3-percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for genitourinary system procedures, and a 5-percent increase in aggregate payment amounts for integumentary system procedures.</p>
          <p id="p-2850" data-page="67024">An estimated increase in aggregate payment for the specialty group does not mean that all procedures in the group will experience increased payment rates. For example, the estimated increase for CY 2015 for digestive system procedures is likely due to an increase in the ASC payment weight for some of the high volume procedures, such as CPT code 43239 (Upper GI endoscopy biopsy) where estimated payment will increase by 9 percent for CY 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-2851" data-page="67024">Also displayed in Table 50 is a separate estimate of Medicare ASC payments for the group of separately payable covered ancillary items and services. The payment estimates for the covered surgical procedures include the costs of packaged ancillary items and services. We estimate that aggregate payments for these items and services will decrease by 4 percent for CY 2015.</p>

          <br><p><b>(3) Estimated Effects of ASC Payment System Policies on Beneficiaries</b></p>
          <p id="p-2857" data-page="67025">We estimate that the CY 2015 update to the ASC payment system will be generally positive for beneficiaries with respect to the new procedures that we are adding to the ASC list of covered surgical procedures and for those that we are designating as office-based for CY 2015. First, other than certain preventive services where coinsurance and the Part B deductible is waived to comply with section 1833(a)(1) and (b) of the Act, the ASC coinsurance rate for all procedures is 20 percent. This contrasts with procedures performed in HOPDs under the OPPS, where the beneficiary is responsible for copayments that range from 20 percent to 40 percent of the procedure payment (other than for certain preventive services). Second, in almost all cases, the ASC payment rates under the ASC payment system are lower than payment rates for the same procedures under the OPPS. Therefore, the beneficiary coinsurance amount under the ASC payment system will almost always be less than the OPPS copayment amount for the same services. (The only exceptions would be if the ASC coinsurance amount exceeds the inpatient deductible. The statute requires that copayment amounts under the OPPS not exceed the inpatient deductible.) Beneficiary coinsurance for services migrating from physicians&apos; offices to ASCs may decrease or increase under the revised ASC payment system, depending on the particular service and the relative payment amounts under the MPFS compared to the ASC. However, for those additional procedures that we are designating as office-based in CY 2015, the beneficiary coinsurance amount under the ASC payment system generally will be no greater than the beneficiary coinsurance under the MPFS because the coinsurance under both payment systems generally is 20 percent (except for certain preventive services where the coinsurance is waived under both payment systems).</p>

          <br><p><b>d. Effects of Requirements for the Hospital OQR Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-2860" data-page="67026">In section XIII. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing policies affecting the Hospital OQR Program. Of 3,325 hospitals that met eligibility requirements for the CY 2014 payment determination, we determined that 88 hospitals did not meet the requirements to receive the full OPD fee schedule increase factor. Most of these hospitals (70 of the 88) chose not to participate in the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2014 payment determination. We estimate that approximately 90 hospitals will not receive the full OPD fee schedule increase factor for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <p id="p-2861" data-page="67026">In section XIII.E. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to add one claims-based quality measure, OP-32: Facility 7-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy, for the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years, instead of the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years as proposed. Because this measure is claims-based, it will not require additional burden from data reporting or other action on the part of the hospitals. Therefore, we do not anticipate that this measure will cause any additional facilities to fail to meet requirements the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <p id="p-2862" data-page="67026">In section XIII.C.3. of this final rule with comment period, for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years, we are finalizing our proposal to remove OP-6 and OP-7 from the Hospital OQR Program. However, we are not finalizing our proposal to remove OP-4 and are retaining that measure in the Hospital OQR Program for reasons discussed in section XIII.C.3. In sections XIII.D.3.b. and c. of this final rule with comment period, we are also finalizing our proposal to exclude OP-31 from the CY 2016 payment determination measure set and to change that measure from required to voluntary for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. Hospitals will not be subject to a payment reduction with respect to this measure for the CY 2016 payment determination or during the period of voluntary reporting.</p>
          <p id="p-2863" data-page="67026">We anticipate a reduction in burden of approximately 840,517 hours or $25.2 million across participating hospitals from the two measures we are removing and the measure we are making voluntary, as further detailed in sections XIII.C.3. and XIII.D.3.c. of this final rule with comment period, respectively, and the information collection requirements in section XIX.C.1. of this final rule with comment period. We refer readers to the information collection requirements section of this final rule with comment period (section XIX.C.1. of this final rule with comment period) for a detailed discussion of the financial burden of the requirements of the Hospital OQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2864" data-page="67026">The validation requirements that we are finalizing for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years will result in medical record documentation of approximately 6,000 cases per quarter (up to 12 cases per quarter for 500 hospitals) submitted to the designated CMS contractor. In section XIII.H.3.e. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to allow hospitals to submit medical record documentation for validation using either of two methods: (1) Through paper medical records; or (2) by securely transmitting electronic versions of medical information by either (a) downloading or copying the digital image (that is, a PDF) of the patient chart onto CD, DVD, or flash drive and shipping the electronic media following instructions specified on the QualityNet Web site; or (b) securely submitting digital images (PDFs) of patient charts using a Secure File Transfer Portal on the QualityNet Web site.</p>
          <p id="p-2865" data-page="67026">As stated in prior rulemaking (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74577">76 FR 74577</a>), we will pay for the cost of sending paper medical record documentation to the designated CMS contractor at the rate of 12 cents per page for copying and approximately $1.00 per case for postage. For both new electronic methods, we are finalizing our proposal in the information collection requirements section of this final rule with comment period to reimburse hospitals for sending medical records electronically at a rate of $3.00 per patient chart.</p>
          <p id="p-2866" data-page="67026">As we stated in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75192">78 FR 75192</a>), we have found that an outpatient medical chart generally contains up to 10 pages. However, because we do not yet know how many hospitals will choose to submit data electronically or through paper, we cannot estimate the total cost of expenditures and are unable to estimate the number of hospitals that will fail the validation documentation submission requirement for the CY 2017 payment determination. Because we will pay for the data collection effort, we believe that a requirement for medical record documentation for up to12 cases per quarter for 500 hospitals for CY 2015 represents a minimal burden to Hospital OQR Program participating hospitals.</p>
          <br><p><b>e. Effects of CY 2015 Policies for the ASCQR Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-2867" data-page="67026">In section XIV. of this final rule with comment period, we are adopting policies affecting the ASCQR Program. Of 5,260 ASCs that met eligibility requirements for CY 2014, we determined that 116 ASCs did not meet the requirements to receive the full annual payment update.</p>
          <p id="p-2868" data-page="67026">In section XIV.B.5. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing the adoption of one claims-based quality measure, ASC-12: Facility Seven-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy, for the ASCQR Program beginning with the CY 2018 payment determination, rather than beginning with the CY 2017 payment determination as proposed. The measure is claims-based and will not require additional data reporting or other action by ASCs. Therefore, we do not anticipate that this measure will cause any additional ASCs to fail to meet the ASCQR Program requirements. We present the time and burdens associated with our finalized policies and proposals in section XIX.C.2. of this final rule with comment period.</p>

          <p id="p-2869" data-page="67026">In section XIV.E.3.b. of this final rule with comment period, we noted the 3-<span id="page-67027" class="printed_page" data-page="67027"> </span>month delay in data collection for ASC-9 and ASC-10 for the CY 2016 payment determination. We do not believe that this 3-month delay in data collection will significantly affect the number of ASCs that meet the ASCQR Program requirements.</p>
          <p id="p-2870" data-page="67027">In section XIV.E.3.c. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal that ASC-11, which was to be first included in the CY 2016 payment determination, will not be included in the CY 2016 measure set, and that the measure will be voluntary for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. ASCs will not be subject to a payment reduction for the CY 2016 payment determination, nor will ASCs be subject to a payment reduction for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years for failing to report this voluntary measure. Because this measure has not yet affected any payment determination, we do not believe that there will be any impact on the number of ASCs that meet the ASCQR Program requirements as a result of our decision not to include this measure in the measure set for the CY 2016 payment determination and to make this measure voluntary for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <p id="p-2871" data-page="67027">We do not believe that the other measures we previously adopted will cause any additional ASCs to fail to meet the ASCQR Program requirements. (We refer readers to the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period for a list of these measures (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75130">78 FR 75130</a>)).</p>
          <p id="p-2872" data-page="67027">Further, we do not believe that any of the other proposals we are finalizing in this final rule with comment period will significantly affect the number of ASCs that do not receive a full annual payment update for the CY 2017 payment determination. We are unable to estimate the number of ASCs that will not receive the full annual payment update based on the CY 2015 and CY 2016 payment determinations (<a href="/citation/78-FR-75192">78 FR 75192</a>). For this reason, using the CY 2014 payment determination numbers as a baseline, we estimate that approximately 116 ASCs will not receive the full annual payment update in CY 2017 due to failure to meet the ASCQR Program requirements.</p>
          <p id="p-2873" data-page="67027">We invited public comment on the burden associated with these information collection requirements. We did not receive any public comments.</p>
          <br><p><b>f. Effects of Changes to the Rural Provider and Hospital Ownership Exceptions to the Physician Self-Referral Law</b></p>
          <p id="p-2874" data-page="67027">Section 6001(a) of the Affordable Care Act amended the rural provider and hospital ownership exceptions to the physician self-referral law (sections 1877(d)(2) and (d)(3) of the Act, respectively) to impose additional restrictions on physician ownership or investment in hospitals. The amended rural provider and hospital ownership exceptions provide that a hospital may not increase the number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds beyond that for which the hospital was licensed on March 23, 2010 (or, in the case of a hospital that did not have a provider agreement in effect as of this date, but did have a provider agreement in effect on December 31, 2010, the date of effect of such agreement). We issued regulations addressing the prohibition against facility expansion in the CY 2011 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/75-FR-72240">75 FR 72240</a>).</p>
          <p id="p-2875" data-page="67027">Section 6001(a)(3) of the Affordable Care Act added section 1877(i)(3)(A)(i) of the Act to set forth that the Secretary shall establish and implement an exception process to the prohibition on expansion of facility capacity. We issued regulations that govern the expansion exception process in the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (<a href="/citation/76-FR-74517">76 FR 74517</a>) at <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2014/11/10/42-CFR-411.362">42 CFR 411.362</a>(c). The regulations addressing the expansion exception process were issued by January 1, 2012, and the process was implemented on February 1, 2012.</p>
          <p id="p-2876" data-page="67027">As required by the statute, the expansion exception process provides that hospitals that qualify as an &#x201C;applicable hospital&#x201D; or a &#x201C;high Medicaid facility&#x201D; may request an exception to the prohibition on facility expansion. The existing expansion exception process requires the use of filed Medicare cost report data from the Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) for hospitals to demonstrate that they satisfy the relevant eligibility criteria set forth in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2) for applicable hospitals and &#xA7; 411.362(c)(3) for high Medicaid facilities (<a href="/citation/76-FR-42350">76 FR 42350</a> through 42352). As discussed in section XV.C. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (<a href="/citation/79-FR-41054">79 FR 41054</a> through 41056), we proposed to permit physician-owned hospitals to use certain non-HCRIS data sources to demonstrate satisfaction of the expansion exception process eligibility criteria. In section XV.C. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal with certain modifications. Under our policy, we will continue to require each hospital seeking to qualify for an expansion exception to access and utilize data for its estimations or determinations to demonstrate that the hospital meets the relevant criteria and to provide a detailed explanation regarding whether and how it satisfies each of the relevant criteria. We believe the impact of our modification on affected hospitals will be minimal, given that the use of data from a non-HCRIS data source is voluntary.</p>
          <p id="p-2877" data-page="67027">Our policy will require each requesting hospital also to provide actual notification that it is requesting an expansion exception directly to hospitals whose data are part of the comparisons set forth in &#xA7; 411.362(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(ii) of the regulations, in addition to performing the other methods of notification specified in our existing regulations. We are finalizing this policy, and we believe the impact of this additional requirement on physician-owned hospitals will be minimal.</p>

          <p id="p-2878" data-page="67027">We believe that our policy will affect a relatively small number of physician-owned hospitals. We estimate that there are approximately 265 physician-owned hospitals in the country. Since the process was implemented in February 2012, we have received only four requests, only one of which has been considered sufficiently complete to continue with publication in the <span class="E-04">Federal Register</span>, under the current regulations. We anticipate receiving a similar number of requests each year. We do not believe that we can use the four requests to estimate accurately the potential increase in operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds pursuant to approved expansion exception requests, and we are not aware of any data that may indicate such an increase. At this time, we also have no data or projections that may help estimate the number of physicians that will be affected by these proposals as a result of their ownership interests in hospitals.</p>
          <p id="p-2879" data-page="67027">We believe that beneficiaries may be positively impacted by our policies. Specifically, an increase in operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds may augment the volume or nature of services offered by physician-owned hospitals. An expansion in the number of hospital beds may also permit additional inpatient admissions and overnight stays. Increased operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds may result in improved access to health care facilities and services. We believe that our policies are necessary to conform our regulations to the amendments to section 1877 of the Act.</p>

          <p id="p-2880" data-page="67027">We solicited public comments on each of the issues outlined above that contain estimates of the costs and benefits of the proposed rule. We specifically solicited comments on the potential impact on State governments, because we proposed to define external<span id="page-67028" class="printed_page" data-page="67028"> </span>data sources as data sources generated, maintained, or under the control of a State Medicaid agency. We did not receive any public comments on our estimates.</p>
          <br><p><b>g. Effects of Policies Related to CMS-Identified Overpayments Associated With Payment Data Submitted by Medicare Advantage (MA) Organizations and Medicare Part D Sponsors</b></p>
          <p id="p-2881" data-page="67028">In section XVII. of this final rule with comment period, we discuss our final decisions to set forth in regulations a formal process, including appeals processes, that allows us to recoup overpayments in the limited set of circumstances where CMS makes a determination that an overpayment to an MA organization or Part D sponsor occurred because the organization or sponsor submitted erroneous payment data to CMS. It is difficult to predict how many times CMS will annually determine an overpayment due to erroneous payment data submitted to CMS by an MA organization or Part D sponsor and that, therefore, will be subject to the offset and appeals regulations. However, we predict that it will be highly unlikely to exceed 10 cases a year and will probably be fewer. Further, electing to appeal a CMS overpayment determination under the final regulations is completely at the discretion of the MA organization or Part D sponsor. The MA organization or Part D sponsor may agree that the data require correction and resubmit the data; MA organizations and Part D sponsors that receive notification of an overpayment are under no obligation to initiate the appeal process. If the MA organization or Part D sponsor chooses not to appeal, there are no costs or burden associated with the appeal. If the MA organization or Part D sponsor chooses to appeal the overpayment determination, there will be costs associated with preparing the appeal request.</p>
          <p id="p-2882" data-page="67028">We are establishing three levels of appeal (reconsideration, informal hearing, and Administrator review), each of which the MA organization or Part D sponsor will have to request. Once the appeal has been filed, however; there will be little or no cost experienced by the MA organization or Part D sponsor because the appeal process is on the record and will not involve oral testimony. The extent to which there will be costs associated with preparing the appeal request is subject to preference and choice. We estimate that it will take a plan 5 hours to prepare and file a reconsideration request. In terms of cost, it has been our experience that most appeals have been prepared by high-level officials of the plan or lawyers. According to the most recent wage data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for May 2012, the mean hourly wage for the category of &#x201C;Lawyers&#x201D;&#x2014;which we believe, considering the variety of officials who have submitted appeals, is the most appropriate category&#x2014;is $62.93. Multiplying this figure by 50 hours (10 submissions &#xD7; 5 hours) results in a projected annual cost burden of $3,147. We estimate the preparation and filing of a request for a hearing, or for Administrator&apos;s review will take 2 hours, at most, because the MA organization or Part D sponsor cannot submit new evidence. The hearing officer or Administrator is limited to a review of the record. Multiplying this figure by 40 hours (10 submissions &#xD7; 4 hours) results in a projected annual cost burden of $2,517. It is estimated that if the costs of benefits and overhead are included, the total annual costs for requests at the three levels will be approximately $11,000.</p>

<h4><a name="394"></a>B. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) Analysis</h4>


          <p id="p-2883" data-page="67028">The RFA requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory relief of small entities, if a rule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we estimate that most hospitals, ASCs and CMHCs are small entities as that term is used in the RFA. For purposes of the RFA, most hospitals are considered small businesses according to the Small Business Administration&apos;s size standards with total revenues of $38.5 million or less in any single year. Most ASCs and most CMHCs are considered small businesses with total revenues of $15 million or less in any single year. We estimate that this final rule with comment period may have a significant impact on approximately 2,006 hospitals with voluntary ownership.

          <p id="p-2884" data-page="67028">In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires us to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a metropolitan statistical area and has 100 or fewer beds. We estimate that this final rule with comment period may have a significant impact on approximately 709 small rural hospitals.</p>

<h4><a name="395"></a>C. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act Analysis</h4>

          <p id="p-2886" data-page="67028">Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) also requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates require spending in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. That threshold level is currently approximately $141 million. This final rule with comment period does not mandate any requirements for State, local, or tribal governments, or for the private sector.</p>

<h4><a name="396"></a>D. Conclusion</h4>

          <p id="p-2887" data-page="67028">The changes we are making in this final rule with comment period will affect all classes of hospitals paid under the OPPS and will affect both CMHCs and ASCs. We estimate that most classes of hospitals paid under the OPPS will experience a modest increase or a minimal decrease in payment for services furnished under the OPPS in CY 2015. Table 49 demonstrates the estimated distributional impact of the OPPS budget neutrality requirements that will result in a 2.3 percent increase in payments for all services paid under the OPPS in CY 2015, after considering all of the changes to APC reconfiguration and recalibration, as well as the OPD fee schedule increase factor, wage index changes, including the frontier State wage index adjustment, estimated payment for outliers, and changes to the pass-through payment estimate. However, some classes of providers that are paid under the OPPS will experience more significant gains and others will experience modest losses in OPPS payments in CY 2015.</p>

          <p id="p-2888" data-page="67028">The updates to the ASC payment system for CY 2015 will affect each of the approximately 5,300 ASCs currently approved for participation in the Medicare program. The effect on an individual ASC will depend on its mix of patients, the proportion of the ASC&apos;s patients who are Medicare beneficiaries, the degree to which the payments for the procedures offered by the ASC are changed under the ASC payment system, and the extent to which the ASC provides a different set of procedures in the coming year. Table 50 demonstrates the estimated distributional impact among ASC surgical specialties of the<span id="page-67029" class="printed_page" data-page="67029"> </span>MFP-adjusted CPI-U update factor of 1.4 percent for CY 2015.</p>

<h3>XXII. Federalism Analysis </h3>


          <p id="p-2889" data-page="67029"><a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13132">Executive Order 13132</a> establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it promulgates a proposed rule (and subsequent final rule) that imposes substantial direct costs on State and local governments, preempts State law, or otherwise has Federalism implications. We have examined the OPPS and ASC provisions included in this final rule with comment period in accordance with <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13132">Executive Order 13132,</a> Federalism, and have determined that they will not have a substantial direct effect on State, local or tribal governments, preempt State law, or otherwise have a Federalism implication. As reflected in Table 49 of this final rule with comment period, we estimate that OPPS payments to governmental hospitals (including State and local governmental hospitals) will increase by 2.1 percent under this final rule with comment period. While we do not know the number of ASCs or CMHCs with government ownership, we anticipate that it is small. The analyses we have provided in this section of this final rule with comment period, in conjunction with the remainder of this document, demonstrate that this final rule with comment period is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in Executive Order 12866, the RFA, and section 1102(b) of the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-2890" data-page="67029">This final rule with comment period will affect payments to a substantial number of small rural hospitals and a small number of rural ASCs, as well as other classes of hospitals, CMHCs, and ASCs, and some effects may be significant.</p>
