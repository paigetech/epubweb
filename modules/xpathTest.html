<h4>A. Executive Summary of This Document</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Purpose</b></p>

          <p id="p-589" data-page="66775">In this final rule with comment period, we are updating the payment policies and payment rates for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in hospital outpatient departments and<span id="page-66776" class="printed_page" data-page="66776"> </span>Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) beginning January 1, 2015. Section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to annually review and update the relative payment weights and the conversion factor for services payable under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). Under section 1833(i) of the Act, we annually review and update the ASC payment rates. We describe these and various other statutory authorities in the relevant sections of this final rule with comment period. In addition, this final rule with comment period updates and refines the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program and the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program.</p>
          <p id="p-590" data-page="66776">In this document, we also are making changes to the data sources permitted for expansion requests for physician-owned hospitals under the physician self-referral regulations; changes to the underlying authority for the requirement of an admission order for all hospital inpatient admissions and changes to require physician certification for hospital inpatient admissions only for long-stay cases and outlier cases; and changes to establish a formal process, including a three-level appeals process, to recoup overpayments that result from the submission of erroneous payment data by Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations and Part D sponsors in the limited circumstances in which the organization or sponsor fails to correct these data.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Summary of the Major Provisions</b></p>
          <ul class="bullets"><li id="p-591" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">OPPS Update:</i> For CY 2015, we are increasing the payment rates under the OPPS by an Outpatient Department (OPD) fee schedule increase factor of 2.2 percent. This increase is based on the final hospital inpatient market basket percentage increase of 2.9 percent for inpatient services paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), minus the multifactor productivity (MFP) adjustment of 0.5 percentage point, and minus a 0.2 percentage point adjustment required by the Affordable Care Act. Under this final rule with comment period, we estimate that total payments for CY 2015, including beneficiary cost-sharing, to the approximate 4,000 facilities paid under the OPPS (including general acute care hospitals, children&apos;s hospitals, cancer hospitals, and community mental health centers (CMHCs)), will be approximately $56.1 billion, an increase of approximately $5.1 billion compared to CY 2014 payments, or $900 million excluding our estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix.</li></ul>
          <p id="p-592" data-page="66776">We are continuing to implement the statutory 2.0 percentage point reduction in payments for hospitals failing to meet the hospital outpatient quality reporting requirements, by applying a reporting factor of 0.980 to the OPPS payments and copayments for all applicable services.</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-593" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Rural Adjustment:</i> We are continuing the adjustment of 7.1 percent to the OPPS payments to certain rural sole community hospitals (SCHs), including essential access community hospitals (EACHs). This adjustment will apply to all services paid under the OPPS, excluding separately payable drugs and biologicals, devices paid under the pass-through payment policy, and items paid at charges reduced to cost.</li>
          <li id="p-594" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Cancer Hospital Payment Adjustment:</i> For CY 2015, we are continuing to provide additional payments to cancer hospitals so that the cancer hospital&apos;s payment-to-cost ratio (PCR) after the additional payments is equal to the weighted average PCR for the other OPPS hospitals using the most recently submitted or settled cost report data. Based on those data, a target PCR of 0.89 will be used to determine the CY 2015 cancer hospital payment adjustment to be paid at cost report settlement. That is, the payment adjustments will be the additional payments needed to result in a PCR equal to 0.89 for each cancer hospital.</li>
          <li id="p-595" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Payment of Drugs, Biologicals, and Radiopharmaceuticals:</i> For CY 2015, payment for the acquisition and pharmacy overhead costs of separately payable drugs and biologicals that do not have pass-through status are set at the statutory default of average sales price (ASP) plus 6 percent.</li>
          <li id="p-596" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Packaging Policies:</i> We are conditionally packaging certain ancillary services when they are integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service. The initial set of services packaged under this ancillary service policy are the services assigned to APCs having an APC geometric mean cost (prior to application of status indicator Q1) of less than or equal to $100. This $100 geometric mean cost limit for the APC is part of the methodology of establishing an initial set of conditionally packaged ancillary service APCs, and is not meant to represent a threshold above which a given ancillary service will not be packaged, but as a basis for selecting an initial set of APCs that will likely be updated and expanded in future years.</li>
          <li id="p-597" data-page="66776">
<i class="E-03">Implementation of Comprehensive APCs:</i> For CY 2015, we are implementing, with several modifications, the policy for comprehensive APCs (C-APCs) that was finalized in the CY 2014 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period effective January 1, 2015. We are continuing to define the services assigned to C-APCs as primary services, and to define a C-APC as a classification for the provision of a primary service and all adjunctive services and supplies provided to support the delivery of the primary service. We continue to consider the entire hospital stay, defined as all services reported on the hospital claim reporting the primary service, to be one comprehensive service for the provision of a primary service into which all other services appearing on the claim would be packaged. This results in a single Medicare payment and a single beneficiary copayment under the OPPS for the comprehensive service based on all included charges on the claim.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-598" data-page="66776">We are establishing a total of 25 C-APCs for CY 2015, including all of the formerly device-dependent APCs remaining after some restructuring and consolidation of these APCs (except for APCs 0427, 0622, and 0652) and two C-APCs for other procedures that are either largely device-dependent or represent single session services with multiple components (single-session cranial stereotactic radiosurgery and intraocular telescope implantation). We are modifying the complexity adjustment criteria finalized last year by lowering volume and cost threshold criteria for complexity adjustments. Finally, we are packaging all add-on codes furnished as part of a comprehensive service, which is consistent with our general add-on code packaging policy. However, the add-on codes assigned to the CY 2014 device-dependent APCs will be being evaluated with a primary service for a potential complexity adjustment.</p>

<i class="E-03">Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Update:</i> For CY 2015, we are increasing payment rates under the ASC payment system by 1.4 percent. This increase is based on a projected CPI-U update of 1.9 percent minus a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the Affordable Care Act that is projected to be 0.5 percentage point. Based on this update, we estimate that total payments to ASCs (including beneficiary cost-sharing and estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix), for CY 2015 will be approximately $4.147 billion, an increase of approximately $236 million compared to estimated CY 2014 Medicare payments.<span id="page-66777" class="printed_page" data-page="66777"> </span>

<i class="E-03">Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program:</i> For the Hospital OQR Program, we are adding one claims-based quality measure for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years instead of the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years as proposed. However, prior to publicly reporting this measure, we plan to conduct a dry run (a preliminary analysis) for hospitals to review their performance and provide feedback using the most recently available data. There will be no payment impact during this dry-run period, and the results of the dry run will not be publicly reported. We are refining the criteria for determining &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; measures, and we are removing the OP-6 and OP-7 measures due to &#x201C;topped-out&#x201D; status. In addition, we are updating several previously adopted measures. We are clarifying data submission requirements for OP-27 and are noting a delayed data collection for OP-29 and OP-30. We are excluding one previously adopted measure (OP-31) from the measure set for the CY 2016 payment determination and changing this measure from required to voluntary for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. We will not subject hospitals to payment reductions with respect to the OP-31 measure for the CY 2016 payment determination or during the period of voluntary reporting. In addition, we are formalizing a review and corrections period for chart-abstracted measures. We also are updating validation procedures and changes to regulation text to correct typographical errors. We are changing the eligibility criteria for validation; a hospital will only be eligible for random selection for validation if it submits at least 12 cases to the Hospital OQR Program Clinical Data Warehouse during the quarter with the most recently available data. Hospitals also will have the option to submit validation data using electronic methods and must identify the medical record staff responsible for submission of records to the designated CMS contractor. Finally, we are clarifying how we refer to the extraordinary circumstances extensions or exemptions process.</li>
          <li id="p-601" data-page="66777">
<i class="E-03">Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program:</i> For the ASCQR Program, we are adopting one new quality measure (ASC-12) for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years. This measure will be computed using paid Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims data and will not impose any additional burden on ASCs. We also are excluding one measure (ASC-11) previously adopted for the CY 2016 payment determination and providing that this measure may be voluntarily rather than mandatorily reported for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. We will not subject ASCs to payment reductions with respect to this measure for the CY 2016 payment determination or during the period of voluntary reporting. In addition, we are establishing a measure removal process and criteria, defining data collection timeframes and submission deadlines, and clarifying how we refer to the extraordinary circumstances extensions or exemptions process.</li>

          <p id="p-602" data-page="66777">In sections XXI. and XXII. of this final rule with comment period, we set forth a detailed analysis of the regulatory and federalism impacts that the changes will have on affected entities and beneficiaries. Key estimated impacts are described below.</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Impacts of the OPPS Update</b></p>
          <br><p><b>(1) Impacts of All OPPS Changes</b></p>
          <p id="p-603" data-page="66777">Table 49 in section XXI. of this final rule with comment period displays the distributional impact of all the OPPS changes on various groups of hospitals and CMHCs for CY 2015 compared to all estimated OPPS payments in CY 2014. We estimate that the policies in this final rule with comment period will result in a 2.3 percent overall increase in OPPS payments to providers. We estimate that total OPPS payments for CY 2015, including beneficiary cost-sharing, to the approximate 4,000 facilities paid under the OPPS (including general acute care hospitals, children&apos;s hospitals, cancer hospitals, and CMHCs) will be approximately $56.1 billion, an increase of approximately $5.1 billion compared to CY 2014 payments, or $900 million, excluding our estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix.</p>
          <p id="p-604" data-page="66777">We estimated the isolated impact of our OPPS policies on CMHCs because CMHCs are only paid for partial hospitalization services under the OPPS. Continuing the provider-specific structure that we adopted beginning in CY 2011 and basing payment fully on the type of provider furnishing the service, we estimate a 1.3 percent increase in CY 2015 payments to CMHCs relative to their CY 2014 payments.</p>
          <br><p><b>(2) Impacts of the Updated Wage Indexes</b></p>
          <p id="p-605" data-page="66777">We estimate that our update of the wage indexes and application of the frontier State wage index, including changes resulting from the adoption of the new OMB labor market area delineations and the transitional 1-year, 50/50 blended wage index, will mitigate any negative changes due to the new CBSA delineations.</p>
          <br><p><b>(3) Impacts of the Rural Adjustment and the Cancer Hospital Payment Adjustment</b></p>
          <p id="p-606" data-page="66777">There are no significant impacts of our CY 2015 payment policies for hospitals that are eligible for the rural adjustment or for the cancer hospital payment adjustment. We are not making any change in policies for determining the rural and cancer hospital payment adjustments, and the adjustment amounts do not significantly impact the budget neutrality adjustments for these policies.</p>
          <br><p><b>(4) Impacts of the OPD Fee Schedule Increase Factor</b></p>
          <p id="p-607" data-page="66777">We estimate that, for most hospitals, the application of the OPD fee schedule increase factor of 2.2 percent to the conversion factor for CY 2015 will mitigate the small negative impacts of the budget neutrality adjustments. As a result of the OPD fee schedule increase factor and other budget neutrality adjustments, we estimate that urban and rural hospitals will experience increases of approximately 2.3 percent for urban hospitals and 1.9 percent for rural hospitals. Classifying hospitals by teaching status or type of ownership suggests that these hospitals will receive similar increases.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Impacts of the ASC Payment Update</b></p>
          <p id="p-608" data-page="66777">For impact purposes, the surgical procedures on the ASC list of covered procedures are aggregated into surgical specialty groups using CPT and HCPCS code range definitions. The percentage change in estimated total payments by specialty groups under the CY 2015 payment rates compared to estimated CY 2014 payment rates ranges between &#x2212;4.0 percent for ancillary items and services and 14 percent for hematologic and lymphatic system procedures.</p>
          <br><p><b>c. Impacts of the Hospital OQR Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-609" data-page="66777">We do not expect our CY 2015 policies to significantly affect the number of hospitals that do not receive a full annual payment update.</p>
          <br><p><b>d. Impacts of the ASCQR Program</b></p>

          <p id="p-610" data-page="66777">We do not expect our CY 2015 proposed policies to significantly affect the number of ASCs that do not receive a full annual payment update.<span id="page-66778" class="printed_page" data-page="66778"> </span>

We stated that we believe 4 years is sufficient time for hospitals that have not done so to transition to a more accurate cost allocation method and for the related data to be available for ratesetting purposes. Therefore, in CY 2018, we will estimate the CT and MRI APC relative payment weights using cost data from all providers, regardless of the cost allocation statistic employed. In Table 3 below, we display the impact of excluding claims based on the &#x201C;square feet&#x201D; cost allocation method from estimates of CT and MRI costs in CY 2015.<span id="page-66786" class="printed_page" data-page="66786"> </span>

We will continue to only include cost data from providers that do not use &#x201C;square feet&#x201D; as the cost allocation statistic in relative payment weights through CY 2017. For CY 2018 and beyond, we will estimate the CT and MRI APC relative payment weights using cost data from all providers, regardless of the cost allocation statistic employed.</p>
          <p id="p-671" data-page="66786">In summary, as we proposed, we are continuing to use data from the &#x201C;Implantable Devices Charged to Patients&#x201D; and &#x201C;Cardiac Catheterization&#x201D; cost centers to create distinct CCRs for use in calculating the OPPS relative payment weights for the CY 2015 OPPS. For the &#x201C;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#x201D; and &#x201C;Computed Tomography (CT) Scan&#x201D; APCs identified in Table 3 of this final rule with comment period, we are continuing our policy of removing claims from cost modeling for those providers using &#x201C;square feet&#x201D; as the cost allocation statistic for CY 2015.</p>

          <p id="p-716" data-page="66792">In accordance with our longstanding policy, we proposed to continue to exclude: (1) Claims that had zero costs after summing all costs on the claim; and (2) claims containing packaging flag number 3. Effective for services furnished after July 1, 2014, the I/OCE assigned packaging flag number 3 to claims on which hospitals submitted token charges less than $1.01 for a service with status indicator &#x201C;S&#x201D; or &#x201C;T&#x201D; (a major separately payable service under the OPPS) for which the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) was required to allocate the sum of charges for services with a status indicator equaling &#x201C;S&#x201D; or &#x201C;T&#x201D; based on the relative payment weight of the APC to which each code was assigned. We do not believe that these charges, which were token charges as submitted by the hospital, are valid reflections of hospital resources. Therefore, we deleted these claims. We also deleted claims for which the charges equaled the revenue center payment (that is, the Medicare payment) on the assumption that, where the charge equaled the payment, to apply a CCR to the charge would not yield a valid estimate of relative provider cost. We proposed to continue these processes for the CY 2015 OPPS.</p>
          <p id="p-717" data-page="66792">For the remaining claims, we proposed to then standardize 60 percent of the costs of the claim (which we have previously determined to be the labor-related portion) for geographic differences in labor input costs. We made this adjustment by determining the wage index that applied to the hospital that furnished the service and dividing the cost for the separately paid HCPCS code furnished by the hospital by that wage index. The claims accounting that we provide for the proposed rule and final rule with comment period contains the formula we use to standardize the total cost for the effects of the wage index. As has been our policy since the inception of the OPPS, we proposed to use the pre-reclassified wage indices for standardization because we believe that they better reflect the true costs of items and services in the area in which the hospital is located than the post-reclassification wage indices and, therefore, would result in the most accurate unadjusted geometric mean costs. We proposed to use these pre-reclassified wage indices for standardization using the new OMB labor market area delineations described in section II.C. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <p id="p-718" data-page="66792">In accordance with our longstanding practice, we also proposed to exclude single and &#x201C;pseudo&#x201D; single procedure claims for which the total cost on the claim was outside 3 standard deviations from the geometric mean of units for each HCPCS code on the bypass list (because, as discussed above, we used claims that contain multiple units of the bypass codes).</p>
          <p id="p-719" data-page="66792">After removing claims for hospitals with error CCRs, claims without HCPCS codes, claims for immunizations not covered under the OPPS, and claims for services not paid under the OPPS, approximately 118 million claims were left. Using these approximately 118 million claims, we created approximately 100 million single and &#x201C;pseudo&#x201D; single procedure claims, of which we used approximately 51 million single bills (after trimming out approximately 1 million claims as discussed in section II.A.1.a. of this final rule with comment period) in the CY 2015 geometric mean cost development and ratesetting.</p>
          <p id="p-720" data-page="66792">As discussed above, the OPPS has historically developed the relative weights on which APC payments are based using APC median costs. For the CY 2013 OPPS and the CY 2014 OPPS, we calculated the APC relative payment weights using geometric mean costs, and we are continuing this practice for CY 2015. Therefore, the following discussion of the 2 times rule violation and the development of the relative payment weight refers to geometric means. For more detail about the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC policy to calculate relative payment weights based on geometric means, we refer readers to section II.A.2.f. of this final rule with comment period.</p>

          <p id="p-721" data-page="66792">We proposed to use these claims to calculate the CY 2015 geometric mean costs for each separately payable HCPCS code and each APC. The comparison of HCPCS code-specific and APC geometric mean costs determines the applicability of the 2 times rule. Section 1833(t)(2) of the Act provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the items and services within an APC group shall not be treated as comparable with respect to the use of resources if the highest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary) for an item or service within the group is more than 2 times greater than the lowest median cost (or mean cost, if so elected) for an item or service within the same group (the 2 times rule). While we have historically applied the 2 times rule based on median costs, in the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (</caption>

          <br><p><b>3. Changes to Packaged Items and Services</b></p>
          <br><p><b>a. Background and Rationale for Packaging in the OPPS</b></p>
          <p id="p-914" data-page="66817">Like other prospective payment systems, the OPPS relies on the concept of averaging to establish a payment rate for services. The payment may be more or less than the estimated cost of providing a specific service or bundle of specific services for a particular patient. The OPPS packages payment for multiple interrelated items and services into a single payment to create incentives for hospitals to furnish services most efficiently and to manage their resources with maximum flexibility. Our packaging policies support our strategic goal of using larger payment bundles in the OPPS to maximize hospitals&apos; incentives to provide care in the most efficient manner. For example, where there are a variety of devices, drugs, items, and supplies that could be used to furnish a service, some of which are more expensive than others, packaging encourages hospitals to use the most cost-efficient item that meets the patient&apos;s needs, rather than to routinely use a more expensive item, which often results if separate payment is provided for the items.</p>
          <p id="p-915" data-page="66817">Packaging also encourages hospitals to effectively negotiate with manufacturers and suppliers to reduce the purchase price of items and services or to explore alternative group purchasing arrangements, thereby encouraging the most economical health care delivery. Similarly, packaging encourages hospitals to establish protocols that ensure that necessary services are furnished, while scrutinizing the services ordered by practitioners to maximize the efficient use of hospital resources. Packaging payments into larger payment bundles promotes the predictability and accuracy of payment for services over time. Finally, packaging may reduce the importance of refining service-specific payment because packaged payments include costs associated with higher cost cases requiring many ancillary items and services and lower cost cases requiring fewer ancillary items and services. Because packaging encourages efficiency and is an essential component of a prospective payment system, packaging payment for items and services that are typically integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service has been a fundamental part of the OPPS since its implementation in August 2000. Over the last 15 years, as we have refined our understanding of the OPPS as a prospective payment system, we have packaged numerous services that we originally paid as primary services. As we continue to develop larger payment groups that more broadly reflect services provided in an encounter or episode of care, we have expanded the OPPS packaging policies. Most, but not necessarily all, items and services currently packaged in the OPPS are listed in </caption>

<h4><a name="88"></a>A. OPPS Treatment of New CPT and Level II HCPCS Codes</h4>

          <p id="p-1094" data-page="66837">CPT and Level II HCPCS codes are used to report procedures, services, items, and supplies under the hospital OPPS. Specifically, CMS recognizes the following codes on OPPS claims:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1095" data-page="66837"> Category I CPT codes, which describe surgical procedures and medical services;</li>
          <li id="p-1096" data-page="66837"> Category III CPT codes, which describe new and emerging technologies, services, and procedures; and</li>
          <li id="p-1097" data-page="66837"> Level II HCPCS codes, which are used primarily to identify products, supplies, temporary procedures, and services not described by CPT codes.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-1098" data-page="66837">CPT codes are established by the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Level II HCPCS codes are established by the CMS HCPCS Workgroup. These codes are updated and changed throughout the year. CPT and HCPCS code changes that affect the OPPS are published both through the annual rulemaking cycle and through the OPPS quarterly update Change Requests (CRs). CMS releases new Level II HCPCS codes to the public or recognizes the release of new CPT codes by the AMA and makes these codes effective (that is, the codes can be reported on Medicare claims) outside of the formal rulemaking process via OPPS quarterly update CRs. Based on our review, we assign the new CPT and Level II HCPCS codes to interim status indicator (SI) and APC assignments. These interim assignments are finalized in the OPPS/ASC final rules. This quarterly process offers hospitals access to codes that may more accurately describe items or services furnished and/or provides payment or more accurate payment for these items or services in a timelier manner than if CMS waited for the annual rulemaking process. We solicit public comments on these new codes and finalize our proposals related to these codes through our annual rulemaking process.</p>
          <p id="p-1099" data-page="66837">We note that, under the OPPS, the APC assignment determines the payment rate for an item, procedure, or service. Items, procedures, or services not paid separately under the hospital OPPS are assigned to the appropriate status indicators. Section XI. of the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC proposed rule provided a discussion of the various status indicators used under the OPPS. Assigning procedures to certain status indicators would generate separate payment for the service furnished, while assignment to other status indicators would not.</p>

Through the July 2014 OPPS quarterly update CR, we allowed separate payment under the OPPS for four new Level II HCPCS codes and 17 new Category III CPT codes effective July 1, 2014. Specifically, as displayed in Table 16 in the proposed rule, we allowed separate payment for HCPCS codes C2644, C9022, C9134, and Q9970. We note that HCPCS code Q9970 replaced HCPCS code C9441 (Injection, ferric carboxymaltose, 1 mg), beginning July 1, 2014. HCPCS code C9441 was made effective January 1, 2014, but the code was deleted June 30, 2014, because it was replaced with HCPCS code Q9970. HCPCS code C9441 was granted pass-through payment status when the code was implemented on January 1, 2014.

These codes were listed in Tables 15, 16, and 17 of the proposed rule. We also proposed to finalize the status indicator and APC assignments and payment rates for these codes, if applicable, in this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period. Because the new Category III CPT and Level II HCPCS codes that became effective for July were not available to us in time for incorporation into the Addenda to the proposed rule, our policy is to include the codes, the proposed status indicators, proposed APCs (where applicable), and proposed payment rates (where applicable) in the preamble of the proposed rule, but not in the Addenda to the proposed rule. These codes were listed in Tables 16 and 17, respectively, of the proposed rule. We also proposed to incorporate these codes into Addendum B to this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, which is consistent with our annual OPPS update policy. The Level II HCPCS codes implemented or modified through the April 2014 OPPS update CR and displayed in Table 15 were included in Addendum B to the proposed rule (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site), where the proposed CY 2015 payment rates for these codes were also shown.</p>

In the past, we also have released new Level II HCPCS codes that are effective October 1 through the October OPPS quarterly update CRs and incorporated these new codes in the final rule with comment period updating the OPPS for the following calendar year. For CY 2015, these codes are flagged with comment indicator &#x201C;NI&#x201D; in Addendum B to this OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period to indicate that we are assigning them an interim payment status which is subject to public comment.

In particular, the commenter requested that CMS reassign CPT codes 76825 (Echocardiography, fetal, cardiovascular system, real time with image documentation (2D), with or without M-mode recording); and 76826 (Echocardiography, fetal, cardiovascular system, real time with image documentation (2D), with or without M-mode recording; follow-up or repeat study) from APC 0697 to APC 0269 based on the clinical and resource similarities to the other echocardiography procedures assigned to APC 0269.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> Based on our review of the latest hospital outpatient claims data available for this final rule with comment period, we agree with the commenter that CPT codes 76825 and 76826 should be reassigned to APC 0269, which more appropriately supports the clinical and resource homogeneity of the APCs rather than reassigning the procedure codes to APC 0697. The geometric mean cost of CPT code 76825 is approximately $384, and the geometric mean cost of CPT code 76826 is approximately $285. These costs are sufficiently close to the geometric mean cost of CPT code 93306 (Echocardiography, transthoracic, real time with image documentation (2D), includes M-mode recording, when performed, complete, with spectral Doppler echocardiography, and with color flow Doppler echocardiography), which is approximately $430. CPT code 93306 comprises 93 percent of the service volume within APC 0269. By reassigning CPT codes 76825 and 76826 to APC 0269, only one procedure code would remain in APC 0697. Therefore, we also are reassigning CPT code 93308 (Echocardiography, transthoracic, real time with image documentation (2D), includes M-mode recording, when performed, follow-up or limited study) from APC 0697 to APC 0267 (Level III Diagnostic and Screening Ultrasound) for CY 2015. We are deleting APC 0697 for the CY 2015 OPPS update because all of the procedure codes previously assigned to APC 0697 have been reassigned to more appropriate APCs to ensure adequate payment for the services provided and the clinical and resource homogeneity of APCs.</p>

            <i class="E-03">Comment:</i> One commenter requested that CMS exempt HCPCS code G0460 from the geographic wage index variations to enable hospitals to more willingly participate in the AutoloGel Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) protocols. According to the commenter, HOPDs are reluctant to enroll in the CED protocols because they are concerned that the proposed APC payment rate will not cover the cost of the product, the procedure, the overhead, and the additional administrative effort associated with CED data collection requirements. In addition, the commenter requested that CMS establish a final payment rate for APC 0327 based on the geometric mean cost of $496.99 to help achieve some stability regarding the payment for the procedures assigned to this APC.</p>
          <p id="p-1338" data-page="66870">
            <i class="E-03">Response:</i> We note that comments related to CED protocols or data collection are outside the scope of the proposed rule. With regard to the geographic wage index exemption requested by the commenter, we have never made such an exception. Under the hospital OPPS, all procedures and services that include devices are wage adjusted. Moreover, the payment rates for procedures and APCs are not based on a specific projected amount. The final payment rate for APC 0327 is based on the geometric mean cost of all the procedures described by the HCPCS codes assigned to this APC. We believe that the procedure described by HCPCS code G0460 is appropriately assigned to APC 0327 for the CY 2015 OPPS update based on the clinical and resource similarities in relation to the other procedures assigned to APC 0327. We note that, for this final rule with comment period, which is based on hospital outpatient claims submitted between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, that were processed on or before June 30, 2014, our latest hospital outpatient claims data show no claims reporting the service described by HCPCS code G0460. As has been our practice since the implementation of the OPPS in 2000, we review, on an annual basis, the APC assignments for the procedures and services paid under the OPPS. We will review the APC assignment for HCPCS code G0460 when sufficient claims data become available to determine whether a reassignment to a more appropriate APC is necessary for the CY 2016 update. After consideration of the public comment we received, we are finalizing our proposal, without modification, to continue to assign HCPCS code G0460 to APC 0327 for CY 2015. The final CY 2015 payment rate for HCPCS code G0460 can be found in Addendum B to this CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule (which is available via the Internet on the CMS Web site).</p>

Because a payment offset is necessary in order to provide an appropriate transitional pass-through payment, we deduct from the pass-through payment for contrast agents an amount reflecting the portion of the APC payment associated with predecessor contrast agents in order to ensure no duplicate contrast agent payment is made.</p>

          <p id="p-1469" data-page="66890">Section 1833(t)(14) of the Act defines certain separately payable radiopharmaceuticals, drugs, and biologicals and mandates specific payments for these items. Under section 1833(t)(14)(B)(i) of the Act, a &#x201C;specified covered outpatient drug&#x201D; (known as a SCOD) is defined as a covered outpatient drug, as defined in section 1927(k)(2) of the Act, for which a separate APC has been established and that either is a radiopharmaceutical agent or is a drug or biological for which payment was made on a pass-through basis on or before December 31, 2002.</p>
          <p id="p-1470" data-page="66890">Under section 1833(t)(14)(B)(ii) of the Act, certain drugs and biologicals are designated as exceptions and are not included in the definition of SCODs. These exceptions are&#x2014;</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1471" data-page="66890"> A drug or biological for which payment is first made on or after January 1, 2003, under the transitional pass-through payment provision in section 1833(t)(6) of the Act.</li>

</ul>
          <p id="p-1474" data-page="66890">Section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii) of the Act requires that payment for SCODs in CY 2006 and subsequent years be equal to the average acquisition cost for the drug for that year as determined by the Secretary, subject to any adjustment for overhead costs and taking into account the hospital acquisition cost survey data collected by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in CYs 2004 and 2005, and later periodic surveys conducted by the Secretary as set forth in the statute. If hospital acquisition cost data are not available, the law requires that payment be equal to payment rates established under the methodology described in section 1842(o), section 1847A, or section 1847B of the Act, as calculated and adjusted by the Secretary as necessary. Most physician Part B drugs are paid at ASP+6 percent pursuant to section 1842(o) and section 1847A of the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-1475" data-page="66890">Section 1833(t)(14)(E)(ii) of the Act provides for an adjustment in OPPS payment rates for SCODs to take into account overhead and related expenses, such as pharmacy services and handling costs. Section 1833(t)(14)(E)(i) of the Act required MedPAC to study pharmacy overhead and related expenses and to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding whether, and if so how, a payment adjustment should be made to compensate hospitals for overhead and related expenses. Section 1833(t)(14)(E)(ii) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to adjust the weights for ambulatory procedure classifications for SCODs to take into account the findings of the MedPAC study.</p>
          <p id="p-1476" data-page="66890">It has been our longstanding policy to apply the same treatment to all separately payable drugs and biologicals, which include SCODs, and drugs and biologicals that are not SCODs. Therefore, we apply the payment methodology in section 1833(t)(14)(A)(iii) of the Act to SCODs, as required by statute, but we also apply it to separately payable drugs and biologicals that are not SCODs, which is a policy determination rather than a statutory requirement.

          <p id="p-1512" data-page="66896">Section 1833(t)(6)(E) of the Act limits the total projected amount of transitional pass-through payments for drugs, biologicals, radiopharmaceuticals, and categories of devices for a given year to an &#x201C;applicable percentage,&#x201D; currently not to exceed 2.0 percent of total program payments estimated to be made for all covered services under the OPPS furnished for that year. If we estimate before the beginning of the calendar year that the total amount of pass-through payments in that year would exceed the applicable percentage, section 1833(t)(6)(E)(iii) of the Act requires a uniform prospective reduction in the amount of each of the transitional pass-through payments made in that year to ensure that the limit is not exceeded. We estimate the pass-through spending to determine whether payments exceed the applicable percentage and the appropriate prorata reduction to the conversion factor for the projected level of pass-through spending in the following year to ensure that total estimated pass-through spending for the prospective payment year is budget neutral, as required by section 1833(t)(6)(E) of the Act.</p>

          <p id="p-1549" data-page="66900">Partial hospitalization is an intensive outpatient program of psychiatric services provided to patients as an alternative to inpatient psychiatric care for individuals who have an acute mental illness. Section 1861(ff)(1) of the Act defines partial hospitalization services as &#x201C;the items and services described in paragraph (2) prescribed by a physician and provided under a program described in paragraph (3) under the supervision of a physician pursuant to an individualized, written plan of treatment established and periodically reviewed by a physician (in consultation with appropriate staff participating in such program), which sets forth the physician&apos;s diagnosis, the type, amount, frequency, and duration of the items and services provided under the plan, and the goals for treatment under the plan.&#x201D; Section 1861(ff)(2) of the Act describes the items and services included in partial hospitalization services. Section 1861(ff)(3)(A) of the Act specifies that a partial hospitalization program (PHP) is a program furnished by a hospital to its outpatients or by a community mental health center (CMHC) (as defined in subparagraph (B)), and &#x201C;which is a distinct and organized intensive ambulatory treatment service offering less than 24-hour-daily care other than in an individual&apos;s home or in an inpatient or residential setting.&#x201D; Section 1861(ff)(3)(B) of the Act defines a community mental health center for purposes of this benefit.</p>

<h4><a name="221"></a>A. Background</h4>

          <br><p><b>1. Overview</b></p>
          <p id="p-1880" data-page="66940">CMS seeks to promote higher quality and more efficient health care for Medicare beneficiaries. In pursuit of these goals, CMS has implemented quality reporting programs for multiple care settings including the quality reporting program for hospital outpatient care, known as the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program, formerly known as the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program (HOP QDRP). The Hospital OQR Program has generally been modeled after the quality reporting program for hospital inpatient services known as the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program (formerly known as the Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) Program).</p>
          <p id="p-1881" data-page="66940">In addition to the Hospital IQR and Hospital OQR Programs, CMS has implemented quality reporting programs for other care settings that provide financial incentives for the reporting of quality data to CMS. These additional programs include reporting for care furnished by:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
<li id="p-1882" data-page="66940"> Physicians and other eligible professionals, under the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS, formerly referred to as the Physician Quality Reporting Program Initiative (PQRI));</li>
          <li id="p-1883" data-page="66940"> Inpatient rehabilitation facilities, under the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Quality Reporting Program (IRF QRP);</li>
          <li id="p-1884" data-page="66940"> Long-term care hospitals, under the Long-Term Care Hospital Quality Reporting (LTCHQR) Program;</li>
          <li id="p-1885" data-page="66940"> PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, under the PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting (PCHQR) Program;</li>
          <li id="p-1886" data-page="66940"> Ambulatory surgical centers, under the Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program;</li>
          <li id="p-1887" data-page="66940"> Inpatient psychiatric facilities, under the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting (IPFQR) Program;</li>
          <li id="p-1888" data-page="66940"> Home health agencies, under the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP); and</li>
          <li id="p-1889" data-page="66940"> Hospices, under the Hospice Quality Reporting Program.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-1890" data-page="66940">In addition, CMS has implemented two value-based purchasing programs, the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (Hospital VBP) Program and the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP), that link payment to performance.</p>
          <p id="p-1891" data-page="66940">In implementing the Hospital OQR Program and other quality reporting programs, we have focused on measures that have high impact and support national priorities for improved quality and efficiency of care for Medicare beneficiaries as reflected in the National Quality Strategy (NQS) and CMS Quality Strategy, as well as conditions for which wide cost and treatment variations have been reported, despite established clinical guidelines. To the extent possible under various authorizing statutes, our ultimate goal is to align the clinical quality measure requirements of our various quality reporting programs. As appropriate, we will consider the adoption of measures with electronic specifications to enable the collection of this information as part of care delivery.</p>

          <br><p><b>1. Statutory Basis</b></p>
          <p id="p-2491" data-page="66987">Unless the requirements of an applicable exception are satisfied, section 1877 of the Act, also known as the &#x201C;physician self-referral law&#x201D;&#x2014;(1) prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services payable by Medicare to an entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship (ownership or compensation); and (2) prohibits the entity from submitting claims to Medicare (or billing another individual, entity, or third party payer) for those designated health services furnished as a result of a prohibited referral. The Act establishes a number of specific exceptions to the physician self-referral law and grants the Secretary the authority to create regulatory exceptions for financial relationships that the Secretary determines pose no risk of program or patient abuse. Since the original enactment of the statute in 1989, we have published a series of final rules interpreting the statute and promulgating numerous exceptions.</p>
          <p id="p-2492" data-page="66987">Section 1877(d) of the Act sets forth exceptions related to ownership and investment interests held by a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) in an entity that furnishes designated health services. Section 1877(d)(2) of the Act provides an exception for ownership and investment interests in rural providers. Under the provision of section 1877(d)(2) of the Act, in order for an ownership or investment interest to qualify for the exception, the designated health services must be furnished in a rural area (as defined in section 1886(d)(2) of the Act), and substantially all of the designated health services furnished by the entity must be furnished to individuals residing in a rural area. Section 1877(d)(3) of the Act provides the hospital ownership exception, often referred to as the &#x201C;whole hospital exception,&#x201D; for ownership and investment interests in a hospital located outside of Puerto Rico, provided that the referring physician is authorized to perform services at the hospital and the ownership or investment interest is in the hospital itself (and not merely in a subdivision of the hospital).</p>
          <br><p><b>2. Affordable Care Act Amendments to the Rural Provider and Hospital Ownership Exceptions to the Physician Self-Referral Law</b></p>
          <p id="p-2493" data-page="66987">Section 6001(a) of the Affordable Care Act amended the rural provider and whole hospital exceptions to the physician self-referral law to impose additional restrictions on physician ownership and investment in rural providers and hospitals. Section 6001(a) defines a &#x201C;physician owner or investor&#x201D; as a physician, or immediate family member of a physician, who has a direct or indirect ownership or investment interest in a hospital. We refer to hospitals with direct or indirect physician owners or investors as &#x201C;physician-owned hospitals.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="p-2494" data-page="66987">Section 6001(a)(3) of the Affordable Care Act established new section 1877(i) of the Act, which imposes additional requirements for physician-owned hospitals to qualify for the rural provider or whole hospital exception. In addition to other requirements, section 1877(i)(1) of the Act prohibits a physician-owned hospital from expanding its facility capacity beyond the number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds for which the hospital was licensed as of March 23, 2010, unless an exception is granted by the Secretary.</p>
          <p id="p-2495" data-page="66987">Section 1877(i)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to establish and implement an exception process to the prohibition on expansion of facility capacity. We refer to this process as the &#x201C;expansion exception process.&#x201D; Section 1877(i)(3)(A)(i) of the Act provides that a hospital qualifying as an &#x201C;applicable hospital&#x201D; or a &#x201C;high Medicaid facility&#x201D; may apply for an expansion exception. Section 1877(i)(3)(E) of the Act sets forth the eligibility criteria for applicable hospitals, which include criteria concerning inpatient Medicaid admissions, bed capacity, and bed occupancy. Section 1877(i)(3)(F) of the Act sets forth the eligibility criteria for high Medicaid facilities, which include a criterion concerning inpatient Medicaid admissions.</p>

<h4><a name="362"></a>A. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking</h4>


          <p id="p-2798" data-page="67016">We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the <span class="E-04">Federal Register</span> and invite public comment on a proposed rule. The notice of proposed rulemaking includes a reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms and substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. This procedure can be waived, however, if an agency finds good cause that a notice-and-comment procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest and incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in the rule issued.</p>

CPT codes are copyrighted by the AMA and consist of several categories, including Category I codes which are 5-digit numeric codes, and Category III codes which are temporary codes to track emerging technology, services, and procedures. The AMA issues an annual update of the CPT code set each Fall, with January 1 as the effective date for implementing the updated CPT codes. The HCPCS, including both CPT codes and Level II codes, is similarly updated annually on a calendar year basis. Annual coding changes are not available to the public until the Fall immediately preceding the annual January update of the OPPS and the ASC payment system. Because of the timing of the release of these new codes, it is impracticable for us to provide prior notice and solicit comment on these codes and the payments assigned to them in advance of publication of the final rule that implements the OPPS and the ASC payment system. However, it is imperative that these coding changes be accounted for and recognized timely under the OPPS and the ASC payment system for payment because services represented by these codes will be provided to Medicare beneficiaries in hospital outpatient departments and ASCs during the calendar year in which they become effective.

          <br><p><b>(3) Estimated Effects of OPPS Changes on CMHCs</b></p>
          <p id="p-2832" data-page="67022">The last line of Table 49 demonstrates the isolated impact on CMHCs, which furnish only partial hospitalization services under the OPPS. In CY 2014, CMHCs are paid under two APCs for these services: APC 0172 (Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services) for CMHCs) and APC 0173 (Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services) for CMHCs). Hospitals are paid for partial hospitalization services under APC 0175 (Level I Partial Hospitalization (3 services) for hospital-based PHPs) and APC 0176 (Level II Partial Hospitalization (4 or more services) for hospital-based PHPs). We use our standard ratesetting methodology to derive the payment rates for each APC based on the cost data derived from claims and cost data for the provider-type-specific APC. For CY 2015, we are finalizing our proposal to continue the provider-type-specific APC structure that we adopted in CY 2011. We modeled the impact of this APC policy assuming that CMHCs will continue to provide the same number of days of PHP care, with each day having either 3 services or 4 or more services, as seen in the CY 2013 claims data used for this final rule with comment period. We excluded days with 1 or 2 services because our policy only pays a per diem rate for partial hospitalization when 3 or more qualifying services are provided to the beneficiary. We estimate that CMHCs will experience an overall 1.3 percent increase in payments from CY 2014 (shown in Column 6).</p>
          <p id="p-2833" data-page="67022">Column 3 shows that the estimated impact of adopting the FY 2015 wage index values will result in a small decrease of &#x2212;0.5 percent to CMHCs. We note that all providers paid under the OPPS, including CMHCs, will receive a 2.2 percent OPD fee schedule increase factor. Column 4 shows that combining this OPD fee schedule increase factor, along with changes in APC policy for CY 2015 and the FY 2015 wage index updates, will result in an estimated increase of 1.7 percent. Column 5 shows that adding the frontier State wage index adjustment will result in no change to the cumulative 1.7 percent increase. Column 6 shows that adding the changes in outlier and pass-though payments will result in a &#x2212;0.4 percent decrease in payment for CMHCs, for a total increase of 1.3 percent. This reflects all changes to CMHCs for CY 2015.</p>
          <br><p><b>(4) Estimated Effect of OPPS Changes on Beneficiaries</b></p>
          <p id="p-2834" data-page="67022">For services for which the beneficiary pays a copayment of 20 percent of the payment rate, the beneficiary share of payment will increase for services for which the OPPS payments will rise and will decrease for services for which the OPPS payments will fall. For further discussion on the calculation of the national unadjusted copayments and minimum unadjusted copayments, we refer readers to section II.I. of this final rule with comment period. In all cases, section 1833(t)(8)(C)(i) of the Act limits beneficiary liability for copayment for a procedure performed in a year to the hospital inpatient deductible for the applicable year.</p>
          <p id="p-2835" data-page="67022">We estimate that the aggregate beneficiary coinsurance percentage will be 20.0 percent for all services paid under the OPPS in CY 2015. The estimated aggregate beneficiary coinsurance reflects general system adjustments, including recalibration of the APC relative payment weights, change in the portion of OPPS payments dedicated to pass-through payments, and the CY 2015 comprehensive APC payment policy discussed in section II.A.2.e. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>(5) Estimated Effects of OPPS Changes on Other Providers</b></p>
          <p id="p-2836" data-page="67022">The relative payment weights and payment amounts established under the OPPS affect the payments made to ASCs as discussed in section XII. of this final rule with comment period. No types of providers or suppliers other than hospitals, CMHCs and ASCs will be affected by the proposed changes in this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>(6) Estimated Effects of OPPS Changes on the Medicare and Medicaid Programs</b></p>

          <p id="p-2837" data-page="67022">The effect on the Medicare program is expected to be $900 million in additional program payments for OPPS<span id="page-67023" class="printed_page" data-page="67023"> </span>services furnished in CY 2015. The effect on the Medicaid program is expected to be limited to increased copayments that Medicaid may make on behalf of Medicaid recipients who are also Medicare beneficiaries. We refer readers to our discussion of the impact on beneficiaries in section XXI.A. of this final rule with comment period.</p>
          <br><p><b>(7) Alternative OPPS Policies Considered</b></p>
          <p id="p-2838" data-page="67023">Alternatives to the OPPS changes we proposed and are finalizing and the reasons for our selected alternatives are discussed throughout this final rule with comment period.

          <br><p><b>(3) Estimated Effects of ASC Payment System Policies on Beneficiaries</b></p>
          <p id="p-2857" data-page="67025">We estimate that the CY 2015 update to the ASC payment system will be generally positive for beneficiaries with respect to the new procedures that we are adding to the ASC list of covered surgical procedures and for those that we are designating as office-based for CY 2015. First, other than certain preventive services where coinsurance and the Part B deductible is waived to comply with section 1833(a)(1) and (b) of the Act, the ASC coinsurance rate for all procedures is 20 percent. This contrasts with procedures performed in HOPDs under the OPPS, where the beneficiary is responsible for copayments that range from 20 percent to 40 percent of the procedure payment (other than for certain preventive services). Second, in almost all cases, the ASC payment rates under the ASC payment system are lower than payment rates for the same procedures under the OPPS. Therefore, the beneficiary coinsurance amount under the ASC payment system will almost always be less than the OPPS copayment amount for the same services. (The only exceptions would be if the ASC coinsurance amount exceeds the inpatient deductible. The statute requires that copayment amounts under the OPPS not exceed the inpatient deductible.) Beneficiary coinsurance for services migrating from physicians&apos; offices to ASCs may decrease or increase under the revised ASC payment system, depending on the particular service and the relative payment amounts under the MPFS compared to the ASC. However, for those additional procedures that we are designating as office-based in CY 2015, the beneficiary coinsurance amount under the ASC payment system generally will be no greater than the beneficiary coinsurance under the MPFS because the coinsurance under both payment systems generally is 20 percent (except for certain preventive services where the coinsurance is waived under both payment systems).</p>
          <br><p><b>(4) Alternative ASC Payment Policies Considered</b></p>
          <p id="p-2858" data-page="67025">Alternatives to the minor changes that we are making to the ASC payment system and the reasons that we have chosen specific options are discussed throughout this final rule with comment period. There are no major changes to ASC policies for CY 2015.</p>

          <br><p><b>d. Effects of Requirements for the Hospital OQR Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-2860" data-page="67026">In section XIII. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing policies affecting the Hospital OQR Program. Of 3,325 hospitals that met eligibility requirements for the CY 2014 payment determination, we determined that 88 hospitals did not meet the requirements to receive the full OPD fee schedule increase factor. Most of these hospitals (70 of the 88) chose not to participate in the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2014 payment determination. We estimate that approximately 90 hospitals will not receive the full OPD fee schedule increase factor for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <p id="p-2861" data-page="67026">In section XIII.E. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to add one claims-based quality measure, OP-32: Facility 7-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy, for the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years, instead of the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years as proposed. Because this measure is claims-based, it will not require additional burden from data reporting or other action on the part of the hospitals. Therefore, we do not anticipate that this measure will cause any additional facilities to fail to meet requirements the Hospital OQR Program for the CY 2018 payment determination and subsequent years.</p>
          <p id="p-2862" data-page="67026">In section XIII.C.3. of this final rule with comment period, for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years, we are finalizing our proposal to remove OP-6 and OP-7 from the Hospital OQR Program. However, we are not finalizing our proposal to remove OP-4 and are retaining that measure in the Hospital OQR Program for reasons discussed in section XIII.C.3. In sections XIII.D.3.b. and c. of this final rule with comment period, we are also finalizing our proposal to exclude OP-31 from the CY 2016 payment determination measure set and to change that measure from required to voluntary for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years. Hospitals will not be subject to a payment reduction with respect to this measure for the CY 2016 payment determination or during the period of voluntary reporting.</p>
          <p id="p-2863" data-page="67026">We anticipate a reduction in burden of approximately 840,517 hours or $25.2 million across participating hospitals from the two measures we are removing and the measure we are making voluntary, as further detailed in sections XIII.C.3. and XIII.D.3.c. of this final rule with comment period, respectively, and the information collection requirements in section XIX.C.1. of this final rule with comment period. We refer readers to the information collection requirements section of this final rule with comment period (section XIX.C.1. of this final rule with comment period) for a detailed discussion of the financial burden of the requirements of the Hospital OQR Program.</p>
          <p id="p-2864" data-page="67026">The validation requirements that we are finalizing for the CY 2017 payment determination and subsequent years will result in medical record documentation of approximately 6,000 cases per quarter (up to 12 cases per quarter for 500 hospitals) submitted to the designated CMS contractor. In section XIII.H.3.e. of this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposal to allow hospitals to submit medical record documentation for validation using either of two methods: (1) Through paper medical records; or (2) by securely transmitting electronic versions of medical information by either (a) downloading or copying the digital image (that is, a PDF) of the patient chart onto CD, DVD, or flash drive and shipping the electronic media following instructions specified on the QualityNet Web site; or (b) securely submitting digital images (PDFs) of patient charts using a Secure File Transfer Portal on the QualityNet Web site.</p>
