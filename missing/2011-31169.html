<br><p><b>Background 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-7" data-page="75774">This document amends 26 CFR part 1 to provide rules relating to certain targeted populations under section 45D(e)(2). On May 24, 2005, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (<!!ln dp_fr70 70-FR-29658p70 #70-FR-29658p70>70 FR 29658</a>) to seek comments from the public with respect to how targeted populations may be treated as eligible low-income communities under section 45D(e)(2). In response to the ANPRM, the IRS received various suggestions relating to the definition of the term <i>targeted populations</i> and proposing amendments to the requirements to be a qualified active low-income community business under &#xA7; 1.45D-1. On June 30, 2006, the IRS and Treasury Department released Notice 2006-60 (2006-2 CB 82), which announced that &#xA7; 1.45D-1 would be amended to provide rules relating to how an entity meets the requirements to be a qualified active low-income community business when its activities involve certain targeted populations under section 45D(e)(2). On September 24, 2008, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (REG-142339-05) was published in the

investments. Under 12 U.S.C. 4702(17) as interpreted by 12 CFR 1805.104, the term <i>low-income</i> means having an income, adjusted for family size, of not more than (A) for metropolitan areas, 80 percent of the area median family income; and (B) for non-metropolitan areas, the greater of (i) 80 percent of the area median family income; or (ii) 80 percent of the statewide nonmetropolitan area median family income.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="75775">Section 101(a) of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-135, 119 Stat. 2577) added new sections 1400M and 1400N to the Code. Section 1400M(1) provides that the Gulf Opportunity Zone (GO Zone) is that portion of the Hurricane Katrina disaster area determined by the President to warrant individual or individual and public assistance from the Federal Government under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Act) by reason of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="75775">Section 1400M(2) provides that the Hurricane Katrina disaster area is an area with respect to which a major disaster has been declared by the President before September 14, 2005, under section 401 of the Act by reason of Hurricane Katrina. After determination by the President that a disaster area warrants assistance pursuant to the Act, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) makes damage assessments. The categories for damage assessment in the wake of a hurricane are: flooded area, saturated area, limited damage, moderate damage, extensive damage, and catastrophic damage.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="75775">Under section 1400N(m)(1), a CDE shall be eligible for an allocation under section 45D(f)(2) of the increase in the new markets tax credit limitation described in section 1400N(m)(2) only if a significant mission of the CDE is the recovery and redevelopment of the GO Zone. Section 1400N(m)(2) provides that the new markets tax credit limitation otherwise determined under section 45D(f)(1) shall be increased by an amount equal to $300,000,000 for 2005 and 2006 and $400,000,000 for 2007, to be allocated among CDEs to make qualified low-income community investments within the GO Zone.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="75775">Under section 45D(b)(1), a qualified equity investment does not include any equity investment issued by a CDE more than 5 years after the date the entity receives an allocation under section 45D(f). Under section 45D(f)(3), if the new markets tax credit limitation for any calendar year exceeds the aggregate amount allocated under section 45D(f)(2) for the year, then the limitation for the succeeding calendar year is increased by the amount of the excess. However, no amount may be carried to any calendar year after 2016.</p>
        
<br><p><b>Summary of Comments and Explanation of Provisions 
</b></p>

        <br><p><b>Ownership Requirement and Non-Profit Businesses</b></p>

        <p id="p-21" data-page="75775">Generally, the proposed regulations provide that an entity will not be treated as a qualified active low-income community business for low-income targeted populations unless (<i>i</i>) At least 50 percent of the entity&apos;s total gross income for any taxable year is derived from sales, rentals, services, or other transactions with individuals who are low-income persons for purposes of section 45D(e)(2) (the 50-percent gross-income requirement), (<i>ii</i>) at least 40 percent of the entity&apos;s employees are individuals who are low-income persons for purposes of section 45D(e)(2), or (<i>iii</i>) at least 50 percent of the entity is owned by individuals who are low-income persons for purposes of section 45D(e)(2).</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="75775">Commentators recommended that the ownership requirement for being treated as a qualified active low-income community business for low-income targeted populations under the proposed regulations be amended to accommodate non-profit businesses that are not individually owned. Commentators suggested that if a non-profit business can document that at least 20 percent of its board, with a minimum of two board members, are low-income persons or represent low-income targeted populations, then the non-profit business should be treated as satisfying the ownership requirement.</p>
        <p id="p-23" data-page="75775">The final regulations do not adopt this recommendation because, if a non-profit business does not derive at least 50 percent of its gross income from sales, rentals, services, or other transactions with low-income persons, or if at least 40 percent of the non-profit business&apos; employees are not low-income persons, then the non-profit business is not adequately serving targeted populations solely because 20 percent or more of its board members are low-income persons.</p>
        <br><p><b>Start-Up or Expanding Businesses</b></p>
        <p id="p-24" data-page="75775">Commentators requested that, in order to accommodate start-up entities, the final regulations should provide a rule allowing an entity to meet the requirements to be a qualified active low-income community business for low-income targeted populations if the CDE reasonably expects that the entity will generate revenues within three years after the date the CDE makes the investment in, or loan to, that entity. If an entity serving targeted populations chooses to apply the 50-percent gross-income requirement rather than the employee requirement or the ownership requirement, then the commentators&apos; suggestion could potentially allow an entity to be a qualified active low-income community business for three years without having to meet any requirement. As stated in the preamble of the proposed regulations, this result is clearly inappropriate. Therefore, the final regulations do not adopt the commentators&apos; suggestion. In addition, the final regulations clarify that the three-year active conduct of a trade or business safe harbor in &#xA7; 1.45D-1(d)(4)(iv)(A) does not apply to the 50-percent gross-income requirement.</p>
        <br><p><b>Documenting Low-Income Persons</b></p>
        <p id="p-25" data-page="75775">The IRS and Treasury Department specifically requested comments on what measure of income should be used to determine an individual&apos;s income for purposes of the definition of low-income persons found in the proposed regulations. The proposed regulations asked whether the measure of income should be the same as the measure of income used by the U.S. Census Bureau, the measure of income on the Form 1040, or the measure of income in 24 CFR part 5, which is used for certain Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs and other Federal programs.</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="75775">Two commentators recommended that the IRS and Treasury Department accept as a proxy for income documentation proof of an individual&apos;s participation in other federal programs targeted specifically to low-income individuals and families. The final regulations do not adopt the commentators&apos; recommendation because, as stated in the proposed regulations, the IRS and Treasury Department have not analyzed other Federal programs to determine whether they meet the statutory requirements under section 45D(e), and whether the programs currently meeting the requirements will continue to do so in the future.</p>

        <p id="p-27" data-page="75775">Another commentator recommended that the IRS and Treasury Department allow an entity to measure income using any reasonable method including measures of income by the U.S. Census Bureau, Form 1040, or the HUD rules in 24 CFR part 5. If one measure must be used, the commentator recommended using the HUD rules because they are consistent with low-income determinations used for the Section 8 rental voucher program and the low-income housing tax credit under section
:::index 76p75776

42. The final regulations adopt this commentator&apos;s recommendation that an entity may use any of the three stated methods. Specifically, the final regulations allow an individual&apos;s family income to be determined using household income as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau or HUD, or using the individual&apos;s total family income as reported on Form(s) 1040. An individual&apos;s family income includes the income of any member of the individual&apos;s family (as defined in section 267(c)(4)) if the family member resides with the individual regardless of whether the family member files a separate return. Lastly, the final regulations incorporate the preamble language in the proposed regulations that provides additional detail on what estimates may be relied upon in determining the applicable income limitation for <i>area median family income.</i>
        </p>
        <br><p><b>Items Included in Gross Income</b></p>

        <p id="p-28" data-page="75776">A commentator requested that the final regulations conclude that the term <i>derived from</i> in the proposed regulations includes gross income derived from payments made directly by low-income persons to an entity and amounts and contributions of property or services provided to the entity for the benefit of low-income persons. Another commentator recommended that only operating revenue should be included for the purpose of meeting the 50-percent gross-income requirement.</p>

        <p id="p-29" data-page="75776">The final regulations adopt the first commentator&apos;s recommendation that the term <i>derived from</i> includes gross income derived from both payments made directly by low-income persons to the entity and money and the fair market value of contributions of property or services provided to the entity primarily for the benefit of low-income persons. However, persons providing the money and contributions cannot receive a direct benefit from the entity (notably, a contribution that benefits the general public is not a direct benefit). Accordingly, an entity&apos;s total gross income derived from transactions with low-income persons for purposes of section 45D(e)(2) can include Federal, state, or local grants, charitable donations, or in-kind contributions, as well as collected fees, insurance reimbursements, and other sources of income as long as these payments and contributions are provided for the benefit of low-income persons on an individual basis or as a class of individuals. If an entity receiving such payments can document that those amounts are legally required to be paid on behalf of individuals that meet the definition of low-income persons, the amounts may be treated as derived from transactions with low-income persons. The second commentator&apos;s suggestion to limit a gross income consideration to operating revenue is too restrictive because any money, property, or services provided to the entity may be provided to the entity for the benefit of low-income persons.</p>
        <br><p><b>Owners</b></p>
        <p id="p-30" data-page="75776">The proposed regulations provide that the determination of whether an owner is a low-income person must be made at the time the qualified low-income community investment is made. If an owner is a low-income person at the time the qualified low-income community investment is made, that owner is considered a low-income person for purposes of section 45D(e)(2) throughout the time the ownership interest is held by that owner. A commentator suggested that the rule locking in an owner&apos;s status as a low-income person as of the time of investment should be similarly applied to low-income persons who acquire an ownership interest after the time the qualified low-income community investment is made. The final regulations adopt this suggestion by locking in the status of an owner as a low-income person at the time the qualified low-income community investment is made or at the time the ownership interest is acquired by the owner, whichever is later.</p>
        <br><p><b>Rental to Others of Real Property</b></p>
        <p id="p-31" data-page="75776">Commentators requested clarification on the 50-percent gross-income requirement under the proposed regulations for an entity whose sole business is the rental to others of real property. Because an entity whose sole business is the rental to others of real property will often not have employees, the entity will have to satisfy the 50-percent gross-income requirement or the ownership requirement for low-income targeted populations. To satisfy the 50-percent gross-income requirement, the proposed regulations require that the entity must derive gross income solely from low-income individuals. However, in the case of an entity engaged solely in the rental of property, the entity&apos;s gross income would only be derived from rents, and in many instances, the tenants are not individuals as required under the proposed regulations. Thus, commentators recommend that the 50-percent gross-income requirement be deemed satisfied if at least 50 percent of gross rental income is derived from tenants that are low-income individuals and entities that are qualified active low-income community businesses for low-income targeted populations. The final regulations adopt a rule similar to this recommendation by providing a special rule that generally treats an entity whose sole business is the rental to others of real property as satisfying the 50-percent gross-income requirement if the entity is treated as being located in a low-income community.</p>
        <br><p><b>Gross Income&#x2014;Fair Market Value of Sales, Rentals, Services, or Other Transactions</b></p>
        <p id="p-32" data-page="75776">The IRS and Treasury Department specifically requested comments in the proposed regulations on the question of whether the 50-percent gross-income requirement should be modified to include the fair market value of goods and services provided to low-income persons at reduced fees. Commentators responded by stating that a CDE should have the option to include the fair market value of goods and services provided to low-income persons for purposes of the 50-percent gross-income requirement. The final regulations adopt the commentator&apos;s suggestion but limit the rule to an entity with gross income that is derived from sales, rentals, services, or other transactions with both non low-income persons and low-income persons. The entity may treat the value of the sales, rentals, services, or other transactions with low-income persons at fair market value even if the low-income persons do not pay fair market value.</p>
        <br><p><b>Individuals or Groups That Otherwise Lack Adequate Access to Loans or Equity Investments</b></p>

        <p id="p-33" data-page="75776">Commentators have asked that the IRS and the Treasury Department consider defining particular individuals or groups of individuals as lacking adequate access to loans or equity investments. Although the IRS and the Treasury Department cannot include new rules describing additional targeted populations in these final regulations, taxpayers are hereby invited to submit comments: (1) Identifying individuals or groups that may be considered to lack adequate access to loans or equity investments, (2) describing the reasons such individuals or group of individuals qualify as lacking adequate access to loans or equity investments, and (3) suggesting ways for additional targeted populations rules to appropriately limit the definition of such individuals or group of individuals to ensure that the purposes of the targeted populations provision are not abused.

<br><p><b>Special Analyses 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-37" data-page="75777">It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866, as supplemented by Executive Order 13563. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does not apply to these regulations. It is hereby certified that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is based upon the fact that the final regulations provide a benefit to small entities in low-income communities from the proceeds of a tax credit because, consistent with legislative intent, the final regulations allow a tax credit to be claimed in situations where it was previously unavailable without the Secretary providing for such situations in final regulations. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.</p>
