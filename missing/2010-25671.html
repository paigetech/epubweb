        <p>October 5, 2010.</p>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="62809">Take notice that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) staff will hold a Technical Conference on Transmission Vegetation Management Programs on Tuesday, October 26, 2010 from 1 p.m. to approximately 5 p.m. This staff-led conference will be held in the Commission Meeting Room at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. The conference will be open for the public to attend and advance registration is not required. Members of the Commission may attend the conference.</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="62809">The purpose of the conference is to discuss current vegetation management programs and practices as required under the Commission&apos;s Reliability Standards. In Order No. 693 the Commission approved Reliability Standard FAC-003-1&#x2014;Transmission Vegetation Management Program.<sup>
        [1]
      </sup>
          Reliability Standard FAC-003-1 applies to all transmission lines operated at 200 kV and above, and to lower voltage lines designated as critical to the reliability of the Bulk-Power System.<sup>
        [2]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="p-5" data-page="62809">Certain landowners and other affected parties have raised concerns about changes in vegetation management practices implemented following adoption of FAC-003-1. The Commission is interested in obtaining a better understanding of the scope of any changes in vegetation management practices since FAC-003-1 was approved as mandatory and enforceable, and the extent to which such changes resulted from the requirements imposed under FAC-003-1. The Commission is also interested in obtaining a better understanding of the range of vegetation management practices used by transmission owners, and the reasons for selecting a given practice or methodology over alternatives.</p>
