<br><p><b>Executive Summary 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-6" data-page="21138">The Cultural Programs Division, within the Office of Citizen Exchanges of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, announces an open competition for a cooperative agreement to administer the 2010-2012 cycle of the DanceMotion USA Program. The program&apos;s goal is to showcase the best of American dance and provide an opportunity to directly engage priority audiences in foreign countries. The program will consist of approximately four to six tours by approximately the same number of U.S. dance companies,
:::index 79p21139

whose repertoires are representative of American culture (<i>e.g.</i> contemporary, jazz, hip hop, tap.) In addition to public performances, overseas tours will include public workshops, master classes, lecture-demonstrations, outreach activities and interaction with local youth in a wide variety of venues and settings. Priority audiences are those who do not have regular access to American culture, including underserved and younger populations.</p>
        
<br><p><b>Funding Opportunity Description 
</b></p>

        <br><p><b>Authority</b></p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="21139">Overall grant making authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, 87, as amended, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act. The purpose of the Act is &#x201C;to enable the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries * * *; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations * * * and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.&#x201D; The funding authority for the program above is provided through legislation.</p>
        <br><p><b>Purpose</b></p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="21139">Because many countries around the world have strong and honored dance traditions, dance provides an ideal avenue for engagement. The FY 2008 pilot DanceMotion USA program demonstrated the effectiveness of dance in communicating American ideals and values despite language and other cultural barriers. Based on the positive results of the pilot program, and the enthusiastic demand for DanceMotion USA, the Bureau has developed an expanded program for the 2010-2012 cycle that will result in greater outreach potential. Of particular interest to the Bureau is engaging youth and underserved populations through programs in American dance.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="21139">U.S. public and non-profit organizations meeting the provisions described in Internal Revenue code section 26 USC 501(c)(3) may submit proposals that support the goals of the DanceMotion USA Program. Additionally, applicant organizations must provide cost-sharing and demonstrate a capacity to work closely with the Bureau and U.S. Embassies overseas on the administration of the program.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="21139">Under this cooperative agreement, the award recipient will work with the Cultural Programs staff to: Develop a transparent and competitive process for selecting U.S. dance companies; plan, implement and manage the tour schedules; develop and organize pre-departure briefings and a public launch event in Washington, DC; develop educational materials to provide historical and artistic context for foreign audiences (including the general public); evaluate the tours and overall program effectiveness; and plan and coordinate marketing and public relations initiatives that will brand and promote the program in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
        <br><p><b>Requirements of the Award Recipient</b></p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="21139">The DanceMotion USA program requires the award recipient to oversee planning details and facilitate communication among the various stakeholders in the program effectively and efficiently. Proposals should reflect a practical understanding of global issues, and demonstrate sensitivity to cultural, political, economic and social differences in regions where tour groups may perform.</p>

        <p id="p-12" data-page="21139">Applicants must identify all partner organizations and/or venues with whom they are proposing to collaborate, and describe previous cooperative projects in the section on &#x201C;Institutional Capacity.&#x201D;<span>Please note</span> that all sub-grantee considerations and arrangements for all aspects of the tours are subject to review and approval by the ECA Bureau.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="21139">Under this cooperative agreement, and in consultation with ECA, the successful awardee will be required to:</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="21139">1. Design, organize, and implement a transparent open competition process to select approximately four to six U.S. dance groups. Dance genres should be representative of the diversity of U.S. society and culture and should include, among others, contemporary, hip-hop, tap, and jazz.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="21139">The search, adjudication and selection process for the dance companies must consist of an open call to U.S. dance companies with clear and transparent selection criteria geared to final competitive selection by an independent panel that includes an ECA representative, and culminating in a diverse cadre of artists meeting the description in the following paragraph. Final approval of the selection process and selected dance companies will be given by ECA.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="21139">The selected companies (up to 10 dancers) must be able to work with choreography, music and visual artistic expression to convey to international audiences and workshop students ideas about American culture, history and society.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="21139">Participating dancers must be U.S. citizens who are at least 21 years old; demonstrate the highest artistic, performance and teaching abilities; be conversant with broader aspects of contemporary American society and culture; and be adaptable to rigorous touring through regions of the world where travel and performance situations may be difficult. In addition to performances, DanceMotion USA participants will be expected to conduct or participate in master classes, lectures, workshops, impromptu choreography sessions, radio and TV appearances, and other activities with local cultural institutions, dancers, media and students.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="21139">2. Plan and develop, through close collaboration with ECA and our American Missions abroad, approximately four to six tours to countries in regions that may include the Middle East, East Asia and the Pacific, Africa, South and Central Asia, Europe and/or South/Central American regions.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="21139">For each overseas location, the award recipient will need to actively work with our Embassies and Consulates abroad to find and secure appropriate venues for performances and workshops. The award recipient may find that a pre-tour trip to one or two overseas locations might be a desirable planning aid.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="21139">Special attention should be given to describing the applicant organization&apos;s experience with planning and implementing complex and unpredictable logistical scenarios overseas. Applicants should also outline their project team&apos;s capacity for successfully coordinating projects of this nature and provide a detailed sample program (to include itineraries) to illustrate planning capacity and ability to achieve program objectives.</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="21139">For purposes of this competition, please use the following program as a model: One dance company consisting of six dancers and one choreographer travels to Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon and Syria for one week each.</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="21139">3. Manage the full array of tour logistics including:</p>

        <p id="p-52" data-page="21140">Applicants must provide cost-sharing. Proposals that contain a minimum percentage of 20% cost sharing of the total project budget required for this project, will be deemed more competitive under the &#x201C;Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Sharing&#x201D; review criteria (number 6).

        <br><p><b>V.3d.2Diversity, Freedom and Democracy Guidelines</b></p>
        <p id="p-80" data-page="21142">Pursuant to the Bureau&apos;s authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. &#x201C;Diversity&#x201D; should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including, but not limited to ethnicity, race, gender, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and disabilities. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle both in program administration and in program content. Please refer to the review criteria under the &apos;Support for Diversity&apos; section for specific suggestions on incorporating diversity into your proposal. Public Law 104-319 provides that &#x201C;in carrying out programs of educational and cultural exchange in countries whose people do not fully enjoy freedom and democracy,&#x201D; the Bureau &#x201C;shall take appropriate steps to provide opportunities for participation in such programs to human rights and democracy leaders of such countries.&#x201D; Public Law 106-113 requires that the governments of the countries described above do not have inappropriate influence in the selection process. Proposals should reflect advancement of these goals in their program contents, to the full extent deemed feasible.</p>
        <br><p><b>IV.3d.3. Program Monitoring and Evaluation</b></p>
        <p id="p-81" data-page="21142">Proposals must include a plan to monitor and evaluate the project&apos;s success, both as the activities unfold and at the end of the program. The Bureau recommends that your proposal include a draft survey questionnaire or other technique plus a description of a methodology to use to link outcomes to original project objectives. The Bureau expects that the recipient organization will track participants or partners and be able to respond to key evaluation questions, including satisfaction with the program, learning as a result of the program, changes in behavior as a result of the program, and effects of the program on institutions (institutions in which participants work or partner institutions). The evaluation plan should include indicators that measure gains in mutual understanding as well as substantive knowledge.</p>
        <p id="p-82" data-page="21142">Successful monitoring and evaluation depend heavily on setting clear goals and outcomes at the outset of a program. Your evaluation plan should include a description of your project&apos;s objectives, your anticipated project outcomes, and how and when you intend to measure these outcomes (performance indicators). The more that outcomes are &#x201C;smart&#x201D; (specific, measurable, attainable, results-oriented, and placed in a reasonable time frame), the easier it will be to conduct the evaluation. You should also show how your project objectives link to the goals of the program described in this RFGP.</p>

        <p id="p-83" data-page="21142">Your monitoring and evaluation plan should clearly distinguish between program <i>outputs</i> and <i>outcomes. Outputs</i> are products and services delivered, often stated as an amount. Output information is important to show the scope or size of project activities, but it cannot substitute for information about progress towards outcomes or the results achieved. Examples of outputs include the number of people trained or the number of seminars conducted. <i>Outcomes,</i> in contrast, represent specific results a project is intended to achieve and is usually measured as an extent of change. Findings on outputs and outcomes should both be reported, but the focus should be on outcomes.</p>
        <p id="p-84" data-page="21142">We encourage you to assess the following four levels of outcomes, as they relate to the program goals set out in the RFGP (listed here in increasing order of importance):</p>
        <p id="p-85" data-page="21142">1. Participant satisfaction with the program and exchange experience.</p>
        <p id="p-86" data-page="21142">2. Participant learning, such as increased knowledge, aptitude, skills, and changed understanding and attitude. Learning includes both substantive (subject-specific) learning and mutual understanding.</p>
        <p id="p-87" data-page="21142">3. Participant behavior, concrete actions to apply knowledge in work or community; greater participation and responsibility in civic organizations; interpretation and explanation of experiences and new knowledge gained; continued contacts between participants, community members, and others.</p>
        <p id="p-88" data-page="21142">4. Institutional changes, such as increased collaboration and partnerships, policy reforms, new programming, and organizational improvements.</p>
        <p id="p-89" data-page="21142">
          <span>Please note:</span> Consideration should be given to the appropriate timing of data collection for each level of outcome. For example, satisfaction is usually captured as a short-term outcome, whereas behavior and institutional changes are normally considered longer-term outcomes.</p>

        <p id="p-90" data-page="21142">Overall, the quality of your monitoring and evaluation plan will be judged on how well it (1) specifies intended outcomes; (2) gives clear descriptions of how each outcome will be measured; (3) identifies when particular outcomes will be measured; and (4) provides a clear description of the data collection strategies for each outcome (<i>i.e.,</i> surveys, interviews, or focus groups). (Please note that evaluation plans that deal only with the first level of outcomes [satisfaction] will be deemed less competitive under the present evaluation criteria.)</p>
        <p id="p-91" data-page="21142">Recipient organizations will be required to provide reports analyzing their evaluation findings to the Bureau in their regular program reports. All data collected, including survey responses and contact information, must be maintained for a minimum of three years and provided to the Bureau upon request.</p>
        <p id="p-92" data-page="21142">IV.3e. Please take the following information into consideration when preparing your budget:</p>
        <p id="p-93" data-page="21142">IV.3e.1.

Budget requests may not exceed $1,500,000. There must be a summary budget as well as breakdowns reflecting both administrative and program budgets. Applicants may provide separate sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location, or activity to provide clarification.</p>
        <p id="p-94" data-page="21142">IV.3e.2. Allowable costs for the program include the following:</p>

        <br><p><b>V.1. Review Process</b></p>
        <p id="p-135" data-page="21144">The Bureau will review all proposals for technical eligibility. Proposals will be deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines stated herein and in the Solicitation Package. All eligible proposals will be reviewed by the program office, as well as the Public Diplomacy section overseas, where appropriate. Eligible proposals will be subject to compliance with Federal and Bureau regulations and guidelines and forwarded to Bureau grant panels for advisory review. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of the Legal Adviser or by other Department elements. Final funding decisions are at the discretion of the Department of State&apos;s Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for assistance awards/cooperative agreements resides with the Bureau&apos;s Grants Officer.</p>
        <p id="p-136" data-page="21144">Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the criteria stated below. These criteria are not rank ordered and all carry equal weight in the proposal evaluation:</p>
        <p id="p-137" data-page="21144">1. <i>Program Planning:</i> A detailed description of each program component and a relevant work plan should demonstrate substantive organizational and logistical capacity. Your agenda and plan should adhere to the program overview of DanceMotion USA and the guidelines described above.</p>
        <p id="p-138" data-page="21144">2. <i>Ability to Achieve Program Objectives:</i> Your proposal should clearly demonstrate how your organization will meet DanceMotion USA&apos;s objectives and goals. The program implementation plan should be comprehensive and feasible. Your ability to recruit, select and tour the highest caliber of American dance groups should be clearly reflected in your proposal. Your proposal should describe how your previous experience with international dance tours will help you achieve the DanceMotion USA program objectives.</p>
        <p id="p-139" data-page="21144">3. <i>Multiplier Effect/Impact:</i> Your proposal should demonstrate your understanding of DanceMotion USA&apos;s impact on cultural diplomacy. Your program plan should include strategies for strengthening long-term mutual understanding, including maximum sharing of information and establishment of long-term institutional and individual linkages. Your proposal should describe your plans for furthering the multiplier effect of DanceMotion USA.</p>
        <p id="p-140" data-page="21144">4. <i>Support of Diversity:</i> Your proposal should demonstrate your organization&apos;s commitment to promoting the awareness and understanding of diversity. Achievable and relevant features should be cited in both your administration of DanceMotion USA (program venue, study tour venue, and program evaluation) and the program content (orientation and wrap-up sessions, site visits, program meetings and resource materials).</p>
        <p id="p-141" data-page="21144">5. <i>Project Evaluation:</i> Your proposal should include a plan to evaluate DanceMotion USA&apos;s success, both as the program activities and components unfold, and at the end of the program. The Bureau recommends that the proposal include a draft survey questionnaire or other technique, plus a description of a methodology to use to link outcomes to original project objectives.</p>
        <p id="p-142" data-page="21144">6. <i>Cost-effectiveness/Cost-sharing:</i> The overhead and administrative components of the proposal, including salaries and honoraria, should be kept as low as possible. All other items should be necessary and appropriate. Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as institutional direct funding contributions. Proposals containing a minimum cost-sharing of 20% of the total project cost will be deemed more competitive under this category.</p>
        <p id="p-143" data-page="21144">7. <i>Institution&apos;s Record/Ability/Institutional Capacity:</i> Your institution&apos;s expert knowledge of the American performing arts and artistic community should be reflected in your proposal. Your proposal should demonstrate an institutional record of successful international exchange programs, including responsible fiscal management and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past Bureau grants as determined by the Bureau&apos;s Office of Contracts. The Bureau will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstrated potential of new applicants. Proposed personnel and institutional resources should be adequate and appropriate to achieve the goals of DanceMotion USA.</p>
