          <i>Needs and Uses:</i> On June 14, 2011 the Commission released Second Report and Order FCC 11-93, published at <!!ln dp_fr76 76-FR-50245p76 #76-FR-50245p76>76 FR 50245, August, 2011, adopting final rules&#x2014;containing information collection requirements&#x2014;for the 17/24 GHz (BSS) to mitigate space path interference between the 17/24 GHz BSS space-to-Earth transmissions and the feeder link receiving antennas of Direct Broadcast Satellite Service (DBS) space stations that operate in the same frequency band.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="79111">Below are the new information collection requirements contained in the Second Report and Order:</p>
        <p id="p-29" data-page="79111">
          <i>47 CFR 25.114(d)(15)(iv)</i>&#x2014;Applicants filing for a space station authorization must file the information required in Section 26.264(a)-(b).</p>
        <p id="p-30" data-page="79111">
          <i>47 CFR 25.114(d)(18)</i>&#x2014;Applicants filing for a space station authorization in the Direct Broadcast Satellite service or the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite service, must provide maximum orbital eccentricity calculations.</p>
        <p id="p-31" data-page="79111">
          <i>47 CFR 25.264(a)</i>&#x2014;Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite service (BSS) must provide a series of tables or graphs with its application, that contain the predicted transmitting antenna off-axis gain information for each transmitting antenna in the 17.3-17.8 GHz frequency band. Using a Cartesian coordinate system wherein the X-axis is defined as tangent to the geostationary orbital arc with the positive direction pointing east, i.e., in the direction of travel of the satellite; the Y-axis is defined as parallel to a line passing through the geographic north and south poles of the Earth, with the positive direction pointing south; and the Z-axis is defined parallel to a line passing through the center of the Earth, with the positive direction pointing toward the Earth, the applicant must provide the predicted transmitting antenna off-axis antenna gain information:</p>
        <p id="p-32" data-page="79111">(1) In the X-Z plane, i.e., the plane of the geostationary orbit, over a range of &#xB1; 30 Degrees from the positive and negative X-axes in increments of 5 degrees or less.</p>
        <p id="p-33" data-page="79111">(2) In planes rotated from the X-Z plane about the Z-axis, over a range of up to &#xB1; 60 degrees relative to the equatorial plane, in increments of 10 degrees or less.</p>
        <p id="p-34" data-page="79111">(3) In both polarizations.</p>
        <p id="p-35" data-page="79111">(4) At a minimum of three measurement frequencies determined with respect to the entire portion of the 17.3-17.8 GHz frequency band over which the space station is designed to transmit: 5 MHz above the lower edge of the band; at the band center frequency; and 5 MHz below the upper edge of the band.</p>
        <p id="p-36" data-page="79111">(5) Over a greater angular measurement range, if necessary, to account for any planned spacecraft orientation bias or change in operating orientation relative to the reference coordinate system. The applicant must also explain its reasons for doing so.</p>
        <p id="p-37" data-page="79111">
          <i>47 CFR 25.264(b)</i>&#x2014;Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz BSS must provide power flux density (pfd) calculations with its application that are based upon the predicted off-axis transmitting antenna gain information submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-38" data-page="79111">(1) The pfd calculations must be provided at the location of all prior-filed U.S. DBS space stations where the applicant&apos;s pfd level exceeds the coordination trigger of &#x2212;117 dBW/m[FN2]/100 kHz in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band. In this rule, the term prior-filed U.S. DBS space station refers to any Direct Broadcast Satellite service space station application that was filed with the Commission (or authorization granted by the Commission) prior to the filing of the 17/24 GHz BSS application containing the predicted off-axis transmitting antenna gain information. The term prior-filed U.S. DBS space station does not include any applications (or authorizations) that have been denied, dismissed, or are otherwise no longer valid. Prior-filed U.S. DBS space stations may include foreign-licensed DBS space stations seeking authority to serve the United States market, but do not include foreign-licensed DBS space stations that have not filed applications with the Commission for market access in the United States.</p>
        <p id="p-39" data-page="79111">(2) The pfd calculations must take into account the maximum longitudinal station-keeping tolerance, orbital inclination and orbital eccentricity of both the 17/24 GHz BSS and DBS space stations, and must:</p>
        <p id="p-40" data-page="79111">(i) Identify each prior-filed U.S. DBS space station at whose location the coordination threshold pfd level of &#x2212;117 dBW/m[FN2]/100 kHz is exceeded; and</p>
        <p id="p-41" data-page="79111">(ii) Demonstrate the extent to which the applicant&apos;s transmissions in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceed the threshold pfd level of &#x2212;117 dBW/m[FN2]/100 kHz at those prior-filed U.S. DBS space station locations.</p>
        <p id="p-42" data-page="79111">(3) If the calculated pfd level is in excess of the threshold level of &#x2212;117 dBW/m[FN2]/100 kHz at the location of any prior-filed U.S. DBS space station, the applicant must also provide with its application certification that all affected DBS operators acknowledge and do not object to the applicants higher off-axis pfd levels. No such certification is required in cases where the DBS and 17/24 GHz BSS assigned operating frequencies do not overlap.</p>
        <p id="p-43" data-page="79111">
          <i>47 CFR 25.264(c)</i>&#x2014;No later than nine months prior to launch, each 17/24 GHz BSS space station applicant or authorization holder must confirm the predicted transmitting antenna off-axis gain information provided in accordance with &#xA7; 25.114(d)(15)(iv) by submitting measured transmitting antenna off-axis gain information over the angular ranges, measurement frequencies and polarizations described in paragraphs (a)(1)-(5) of this section. The transmitting antenna off-axis gain information should be measured under conditions as close to flight configuration as possible.

        <p id="p-47" data-page="79112">(ii) At the location of any subsequently-filed DBS U.S. DBS space station where the applicant&apos;s pfd level in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceeds the coordination trigger of &#x2212;117 dBW/m[FN2]/100 kHz. In this rule, the term subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station refers to any Direct Broadcast Satellite service space station application that was filed with the Commission (or authorization granted by the Commission) after the 17/24 GHz BSS operator submitted the predicted data required by paragraphs (a)-(b) of this section, but prior to the time the 17/24 GHz BSS operator submitted the measured data required in this paragraph. Subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space stations may include foreign-licensed DBS space stations seeking authority to serve the United States market. The term does not include any applications (or authorizations) that have been denied, dismissed, or are otherwise no longer valid, nor does it include foreign-licensed DBS space stations that have not filed applications with the Commission for market access in the United States.</p>
        <p id="p-48" data-page="79112">(2) The pfd calculations must take into account the maximum longitudinal station-keeping tolerance, orbital inclination and orbital eccentricity of both the 17/24 GHz BSS and DBS space stations, and must:</p>

        <p id="p-50" data-page="79112">(ii) Demonstrate the extent to which the applicant&apos;s or licensee&apos;s transmissions in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceed the threshold pfd level of &#x2212;117 dBW/m[FN2]/100 kHz at those prior-filed U.S. DBS space station locations.</p>
        <p id="p-51" data-page="79112">
          <i>47 CFR 25.264(f)</i>&#x2014;The 17/24 GHz BSS applicant or licensee must modify its license, or amend its application, as appropriate, based upon new information:</p>
        <p id="p-52" data-page="79112">(1) If the pfd levels submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section are in excess of those submitted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section at the location of any prior-filed or subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station as defined in paragraphs (b)(1) and (d)(1) of this section, or</p>
