<br><p><b>Summary of the Order 
</b></p>


          <p id="p-7" data-page="62924">1. By this action the Commission amends parts 1, 2, 15, 25, 73, and 90 of the Commission&apos;s rules in order to make non-substantive, editorial revisions to the Table of Frequency Allocations (Allocation Table), related rule sections in part 2, and certain service rules. This action is not intended to modify or otherwise change any licensee&apos;s underlying legal rights and/or responsibilities. In particular, the Commission updates the International Table of Frequency Allocations (International Table) within the Allocation Table so that it reflects the allocation changes that were made at the World Radiocommunication Conference (Geneva, 2007) (WRC-07), which can be found in the <i>WRC-07 Final Acts.</i> The Commission implements these amendments to the Allocation Table with the assistance and concurrence of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). This action serves as a prelude to a rulemaking proceeding that the Commission anticipates initiating in the near future to address substantive changes to the United States Table of Frequency Allocations (U.S. Table) that will be necessary to implement the <i>WRC-07 Final Acts.</i>
          </p>
          
<br><p><b>Discussion 
</b></p>

          <br><p><b>A. Updates to Display Format of the Allocation Table</b></p>
          <br><p><b>Frequency Nomenclature</b></p>

          <p id="p-8" data-page="62924">1. In Radio Regulation No. 2.1 of the 2008 Edition of the ITU <i>Radio Regulations,</i> frequencies are expressed in kilohertz (kHz) up to and including &#x201C;3 000&#x201D; kHz (<i>i.e.,</i> 3,000 kHz). In accordance with ITU Radio Regulation No. 2.1, the Commission&apos;s Allocation Table is revised by expressing frequencies in the High Frequency (HF) spectrum from 3025 to 27500 kHz in megahertz (MHz), <i>i.e.,</i> from 3.025 to 27.5 MHz. This action simplifies the Allocation Table, minimizes a style difference between the ITU Allocation Table and the Commission&apos;s Allocation Table and should help avoid any confusion. WRC-07 added an explanatory note to the ITU <i>Radio Regulations</i> allowing reasonable departures from this style convention where it would pose serious difficulties (ITU Radio Regulation No. 2.1). Thus, in this Order, the explanatory note is reproduced in &#xA7; 2.101(b).</p>
          <br><p><b>Placement of U.S. Footnotes</b></p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="62924">2. In the <i>First Table Clean-up Order,</i> the Commission adopted the ITU&apos;s placement methodology for footnote references in the U.S. Table. Thus, footnote references which appear in the U.S. Table under the allocated services in a band apply to more than one of the allocated services. Footnote references which appear to the right of a service allocation name are applicable only to that particular service. The Commission continues to believe that associating a footnote reference with its pertinent service will assist readers in more easily understanding the restrictions and/or other information pertaining to that allocation.</p>

          <p id="p-10" data-page="62924">3. At NTIA&apos;s request, however, the Commission makes a refinement to its U.S. footnote placement policy. Specifically, in the case of bands with the same service allocation name listed in both the Federal and non-Federal Tables, the Commission adds the condition that for a U.S. footnote to be placed to the right of the service allocation name in the Federal Table, the U.S. footnote must contain a stipulation that is applicable to Federal operations. Similarly, for a U.S. footnote to be placed to the right of the service allocation name in the non-Federal Table, the U.S. footnote must contain a stipulation that is applicable to non-Federal operations. As an example, US13 provides for non-Federal use of 48 frequencies in 3 Federal bands (162.0125-173.2, 406.1-410, and 410-420 MHz). Under the Commission&apos;s current policy, US13 is placed at the bottom of the cell in the non-Federal Table, but is placed to the right of the fixed service (FS) allocation entry in the Federal Table, <i>i.e.,</i>&#x201C;FIXED US13.&#x201D; Because US13 provides only for non-Federal use, however, the Commission believes it is misleading that US13 is placed to the right of the Federal FS allocation entry. Accordingly, the Commission modifies its U.S. footnote display policy, as described in the <i>Order,</i> to account for such a scenario. Consequently, the Commission moves US13 to the bottom of the cell in the Federal Table. Similarly, the Commission moves US319 (which restricts Federal use of certain mobile-satellite service (MSS) allocations to earth stations operating with non-Federal space stations) to the bottom of the cell in the non-Federal Table in the bands 148-149.9, 400.15-401, and 2483.5-2500 MHz.</p>
          <br><p><b>Basing Domestic Footnote Numbers on Frequency Order</b></p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="62924">4. The Commission&apos;s practice for adding domestic (<i>i.e.,</i> U.S., non-Federal, and Federal) footnotes to the U.S. Table has generally been to number these footnotes in ascending order, based solely on the date when the footnote was adopted (<i>i.e.,</i> in chronological order). As a result, because there are currently only 176 actual U.S. footnotes to the U.S. Table within the existing range of U.S. footnote numbers (<i>i.e.,</i> 1-402) there are 226 unused U.S. footnote numbers.</p>

          <p id="p-12" data-page="62924">5. International footnotes to the ITU Allocation Table, however, are organized and numbered in frequency order (<i>i.e.,</i> footnotes are numbered according to the relative place in the radio spectrum of the frequency(ies) to which they refer). For example, currently the first international footnote (RR 5.53) concerns operations below 9 kHz and the last international footnote (RR 5.565) concerns operations in the band 275-1000 GHz. Generally, when a World Radiocommunication Conference adopts a new international footnote, the
:::index 75p62925

Conference adds the footnote to the ITU Allocation Table between two existing footnotes, and, if necessary, it appends a letter (or multiple letters) to the lower-adjacent footnote&apos;s number in order to not disturb the existing frequency order and footnote numbering (<i>e.g.,</i> WRC-07 added RR 5.430A between RR 5.430 and RR 5.431). However, in some cases, a Conference may decide to renumber an international footnote in order to preserve the sequential order. For example, WRC-07 added three bands (137-138, 387-390, and 400.15-410 MHz) to RR 5.347A which are under the lowest band that was listed in RR 5.347A prior to WRC-07 (<i>i.e.,</i> 1452-1492 MHz). Consequently, WRC-07 renumbered RR 5.347A as RR 5.208B. In Appendix B, the complete list of active international footnotes is shown. The Commission does not include the international footnotes that WRC-07 suppressed (<i>i.e.,</i> removed) or show the text of those that have expired.</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="62925">6. In this Order, on a going-forward basis, the Commission implements a new numbering system for domestic footnotes that is based on frequency order. Specifically, for a new (including &#x201C;place-holder&#x201D;) domestic footnote, the Commission will number the footnote in frequency order. For a modified domestic footnote, the Commission will consider whether to renumber the footnote in frequency order in the proceeding addressing the modifications to the footnote. Such actions will better align the U.S. Table with the ITU Allocation Table, which will bring greater consistency to &#xA7; 2.106, and thereby make the Allocation Table more useful to the public and spectrum managers. In addition, the Commission believes that numbering domestic footnotes in frequency order will make them easier for readers to view because, in many instances, the footnotes from cells with multiple footnotes will be grouped together in the United States, non-Federal Government, and Federal Government footnotes that follow the Allocation Table in &#xA7; 2.106 of the Commission&apos;s rules. However, in order to ensure that the transition is non-disruptive for the public and spectrum managers, the Commission restricts the renumbering in frequency order to those footnotes that are significantly revised in this Order.</p>

          <p id="p-14" data-page="62925">7. The Commission makes an exception to our new domestic footnote numbering policy. Specifically, if a new, place-holder, or modified domestic footnote is based, in part, on an international footnote, the Commission will number the domestic footnote by using, where possible, the related international footnote&apos;s number (<i>i.e.,</i> if there is not an existing domestic footnote with the same number as the related international footnote). For example, for the place-holder footnotes discussed in this Order, the Commission bases the numbering on the related international footnote&apos;s number. For modified domestic footnotes, the Commission will consider in the associated proceeding whether to renumber the footnote with a related international footnote&apos;s number. The Commission believes this action will assist both the public and spectrum managers by improving the organization and readability of the U.S. Table and by &#x201C;pointing to&#x201D; the international footnote on which, in part, the domestic footnote is based. Consequently, the Commission amends the domestic footnote numbering nomenclature of the U.S. Table specified in &#xA7; 2.105(d)(5)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of the Commission&apos;s rules to allow for the use of a letter (or letters) after the digits of a domestic footnote number. Similarly, the Commission amended &#xA7; 2.105(d)(5)(i) of the Commission&apos;s rules to recognize that a World Radiocommunication Conference may append a letter, or letters, after the digits of the footnote number when it adds a new international footnote to the ITU Allocation Table. In order to ensure that this transition is non-disruptive for the public and spectrum managers, at this time, the Commission renumbers based on a related international footnote&apos;s number only those footnotes that are significantly revised in this Order.</p>

          <p id="p-15" data-page="62925">8. In this Order, the Commission adds 14 U.S. footnotes and 3 non-Federal footnotes to the Allocation Table and reuses 2 existing U.S. footnote numbers (US226, US269). Specifically, consistent with our new frequency-order footnote numbering policy, the Commission: Adds a new footnote&#x2014;US22&#x2014;in order to reflect in the U.S. Table 28 frequencies designated for disaster communications and 40 frequencies designated for long distance communications; renumbers 7 revised footnotes&#x2014;US216, US294, US335, US399, NG19, NG128, and NG142; and combine two footnotes&#x2014;US351 and US352 (US37). However, for the following new or renumbered footnotes, the Commission assigns numbers based on a related international footnote&apos;s number: The combination of US366, US367, and US396 into a single footnote (US136); a new footnote&#x2014;US142&#x2014;that, <i>inter alia,</i> highlights the availability of the high frequency broadcasting (HFBC) bands 7.2-7.3 and 7.4-7.45 MHz in Region 3 insular areas for U.S. international broadcasters; four new place-holder footnotes that replicate the pre-WRC-07 text of four international footnotes which WRC-07 either modified or suppressed; revised versions of US217 and US229; the combination of US7 and NG135 into a single footnote (US270); and the combination of US269 and US311 into a single footnote (US385).</p>
          <br><p><b>B. Updates to International Table</b></p>

          <p id="p-16" data-page="62925">9. In this Order, the Commission updates the International Table to reflect Article 5, Section IV of the ITU <i>Radio Regulations,</i> Edition of 2008, except as described herein. During our preparation of this Order, the Commission discovered several display errors in the ITU Allocation Table. Consistent with past practice, the Commission will not replicate typographical or other errors that hold the potential to cause reader confusion or convey misleading information. Accordingly, the Commission incorporates the following corrections and updates in the International Table in &#xA7; 2.106 of the Commission&apos;s rules. First, listed in alphabetical order according to the French language: The primary services in the Region 2 Table followed by the secondary service for the band 698-806 MHz; the services in the Region 1 Table for the band 790-862 MHz; and the services in the bands 960-1164, 1300-1350, 9300-9500, and 9500-9800 MHz. Second, the Commission places RR 5.345 under the allocated services in the Region 1, Region 2, and Region 3 Tables for the band 1452-1492 MHz. Third, the Commission merges the bands 2120-2160 and 2160-2170 MHz in the Region 1 and Region 3 Tables to form the band 2120-2170 MHz because those bands list the same services and footnotes. The Commission bases these corrections and updates upon the format specified in the ITU <i>Radio Regulations.</i>
          </p>

          <p id="p-17" data-page="62925">10. With regard to international footnotes, the Commission makes the following 34 corrections: Revise the text of 32 international footnotes (5.58, 5.141, 5.143C, 5.165, 5.169, 5.173, 5.185, 5.201, 5.202, 5.206, 5.247, 5.279A, 5.281, 5.319, 5.322, 5.342, 5.352A, 5.388B, 5.389F, 5.400, 5.417A, 5.425, 5.439, 5.447F, 5.453, 5.468, 5.494, 5.500, 5.508A, 5.509A, 5.522C, and 5.549) so that it fully comports with the ITU <i>Radio Regulations;</i> capitalize &#x201C;Earth&#x201D; in RR 5.335; and 3) change &#x201C;service&#x201D; to &#x201C;services&#x201D; in the last sentence of RR 5.482. In addition, the Commission makes the following simplifications in 13 international footnotes: Update the cross references to 8 ITU Resolutions (Resolutions 33, 124, 143, 212, 221, 222, 223, and 528) in 8 international footnotes (5.345, 5.353A,
:::index 75p62926

5.357A, 5.388, 5.388A, 5.396, 5.462A, and 5.516B) to the version listed in Volume 3 of the 2008 Edition of the ITU <i>Radio Regulations;</i> remove the text of 4 international footnotes relating to the recently concluded 7 MHz Realignment (5.138A, 5.139, 5.141C, and 5.143E) from &#xA7; 2.106; and do not show note 1 of RR 5.208A (which states that this footnote was previously numbered as RR 5.347A). For the 15 international footnotes that have either been corrected or simplified in &#xA7; 2.106, the Commission adds the notation &#x201C;(FCC)&#x201D; to the end of the footnote.</p>

          <p id="p-18" data-page="62926">11. The Commission also partially implements a notation scheme used in the ITU <i>Radio Regulations</i> in the Commission&apos;s list of international footnotes. Specifically, the abbreviation &#x201C;(WRC-07)&#x201D; to the right of an international footnote signifies that WRC-07 modified or added the footnote.</p>
          <br><p><b>C. Updates to International Footnotes in the U.S. Table</b></p>
          <br><p><b>Suppressed International Footnotes</b></p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="62926">12. WRC-07 suppressed three international footnotes (5.83, 5.199, and 5.476) that the U.S. Table currently references. In this Order, the Commission removed the references to these international footnotes from the U.S. Table. Prior to WRC-07, RR 5.83 stated that 500 kHz is an international distress and calling frequency for Morse radiotelegraphy. Because the Commission previously removed any reference to 500 kHz as a distress and safety frequency from part 80 of its rules, the Commission removes the reference to RR 5.83 from the U.S. Table. Prior to WRC-07, RR 5.199 allocated two 100-kilohertz bands to the MSS for the reception on board satellites of emissions from emergency position-indicating radiobeacons (EPIRBs) transmitting on 121.5 and 243 MHz. Because the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ceased satellite processing of 121.5/243 MHz emergency beacons&apos; signals on February 1, 2009, at the request of NTIA, the Commission removed the references to RR 5.199 from the U.S. Table. Prior to WRC-07, RR 5.476 contained a prohibition on the use of shipborne radars in the band 9300-9320 MHz (other than those existing on January 1, 1976). Because this international prohibition expired on January 1, 2001, and because the Commission has already removed the prohibition from part 80 of its rules, it now removes the references to RR 5.476 from the U.S. Table.</p>
          <br><p><b>Modified International Footnotes</b></p>

          <p id="p-20" data-page="62926">13. WRC-07 modified 19 international footnotes that are currently referenced in the U.S. Table. In this section, the Commission reviews these international footnotes. Three of these international footnotes&#x2014;5.444, 5.444A, and 5.519&#x2014;embody substantive allocation changes that, in order to become effective in the United States, would need to be adopted in a future rulemaking proceeding. Because in this Order the Commission updates the text of all international footnotes to reflect the <i>WRC-07 Final Acts,</i> it also creates three place-holder U.S. footnotes&#x2014;US444, US444A, and US519&#x2014;that replicate the pre-WRC-07 text of RR 5.444, RR 5.444A, and RR 5.519, respectively, and replace the references to these three international footnotes in the U.S. Table. By these actions, the Commission maintains the <i>status quo</i> in the U.S. Table until such time as the Commission may consider the substantive modifications that WRC-07 made to these three international footnotes. The Commission addresses these three international footnotes in the following paragraphs.</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="62926">14. Prior to WRC-07, RR 5.444 stated that, in the band 5030-5150 MHz, the requirements of the international standard system (microwave landing system or MLS) take precedence over other uses of this band. WRC-07 revised RR 5.444 such that MLS requirements take precedence over other uses only in the band 5030-5091 MHz. Thus, the Commission adds a new place-holder US444 to the list of U.S. footnotes and, in the Federal and non-Federal Tables, the Commission replaces the references to RR 5.444 with that of US444. The text of new US444 is the same as the pre-WRC-07 text of RR 5.444, except that the reference to &#x201C;No. 5.444A&#x201D; is revised to read as &#x201C;US444A.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="p-22" data-page="62926">15. Prior to WRC-07, RR 5.444A stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that in the band 5091-5150 MHz, after January 1, 2012, no new assignments will be made to earth stations providing feeder links for non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) systems; and that, prior to January 1, 2018, MLS requirements which cannot be met in the band 5000-5091 MHz take precedence over other uses of this band. WRC-07 revised RR 5.444A by extending the date after which no new assignments will be made to earth stations providing NGSO feeder links to January 1, 2016, and by suppressing MLS precedence over other uses of the band 5091-5150 MHz. Thus, to preserve the <i>status quo</i> in the U.S. Table, the Commission adds a new place-holder footnote US444A to the list of U.S. footnotes and, in the non-Federal Table, the Commission replaces the reference to RR 5.444A with that of US444A. The text of new US444A is the same as the pre-WRC-07 text of RR 5.444A, except that the Commission added the phrase &#x201C;for non-Federal use.&#x201D; In order for the WRC-07 modifications to RR 5.444 and RR 5.444A to become effective in the United States, the Commission must adopt them in a future rulemaking proceeding.</p>
          <p id="p-23" data-page="62926">16. Prior to WRC-07, RR 5.519 stated that the band 18.1-18.3 GHz is also allocated to the meteorological-satellite service (space-to-Earth) on a primary basis, that use of this allocation is limited to geostationary orbit (GSO) satellites, and that the power flux-density (pfd) limits must be in accordance with the provisions of Article 21, Table 21-4. WRC-07 expanded this allocation by 100 megahertz in all Regions, and removed the cross reference to the pfd limits in Table 21-4. Thus, the Commission adds new place-holder US519 to the list of U.S. footnotes and, in the Federal and non-Federal Tables, the Commission replaces the references to RR 5.519 with those of US519. The text of new US519 is the same as the pre-WRC-07 text of RR 5.519. In order for the WRC-07 allocation decision contained in RR 5.519 to become effective in the United States, the Commission must adopt it in a future rulemaking proceeding.</p>

          <p id="p-24" data-page="62926">17. Prior to WRC-07, RR 5.227 designated the frequency 156.525 MHz exclusively to digital selective calling (DSC) for distress, safety, and calling. WRC-07, however, took the text from RR 5.227, modified it slightly and combined it with the modified text of RR 5.226, and then reused the footnote number 5.227 for another allocation. In combining the revised requirements for 156.525 MHz with the modified text of RR 5.226, WRC-07 highlighted the 156.525 MHz MMS frequency, additionally specified a 75-kilohertz allocation centered at 156.525 MHz (i.e., 156.4875-156.5625 MHz) for the MMS, and restricted the use of this allocation to distress, safety, and calling via DSC. In addition, WRC-07 revised Appendix 18 of the ITU <i>Radio Regulations</i> to require that all precautions be taken to avoid harmful interference to the frequency 156.525 MHz when using the adjacent frequencies (156.500 and 156.550 MHz). In order to preserve the <i>status quo</i> in the U.S. Table, the Commission adds a new place-holder footnote&#x2014;US226&#x2014;to the list of U.S. footnotes that replicates the pre-WRC-07 text of RR 5.226 and RR 5.227 that is applicable to the 156.2475-156.7625 MHz band, and, in the Federal and non-

Federal Tables, the Commission replaces the references to RR 5.226 and RR 5.227 in that band (156.2475-156.7625 MHz) with that of US226. In order for the WRC-07 allocation decisions now in RR 5.226 and RR 5.227 to become effective in the United States, the Commission must adopt them in a future rulemaking proceeding.</p>

          <p id="p-25" data-page="62927">18. WRC-07 modifications to the remaining 14 international footnotes are minor in nature, and require no further action on our part beyond updating the text of these footnotes to reflect the text now specified in the ITU <i>Radio Regulations.</i> Specifically, nine of the modified international footnotes (5.84, 5.108, 5.111, 5.115, 5.130, 5.145, 5.200, 5.256, and 5.266) involve the deletion of a reference to Appendix 13 of the ITU <i>Radio Regulations,</i> which WRC-07 suppressed, and five of the modified international footnotes (5.79A, 5.82, 5.134, 5.287, and 5.328A) involve updates and the removal of expired information.</p>

          <br><p><b>Fixed Use of Maritime Radiotelephony Frequencies</b></p>
          <p id="p-26" data-page="62927">19. Section 80.371 of the rules describes the radiotelephony working frequencies that are assignable to ship and public coast stations. Paragraph (a) of &#xA7; 80.371 contains a table that describes the working carrier frequency pairs in the band 2000-4000 kHz. NG19 states that fixed stations associated with the maritime mobile service (MMS) may be authorized, for purposes of communication with coast stations, to use the frequencies that are assignable to ship stations in this band on the condition that harmful interference will not be caused to services operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations.</p>

          <p id="p-27" data-page="62927">20. Because NG19 does not explicitly state the bands to which it applies, it may not be readily apparent to readers that it applies to the three bands in which it is listed in the U.S. Table (<i>i.e.,</i> 2000-2065, 2107-2170, and 2194-2495 kHz). In order to assist readers, the Commission explicitly lists the three bands in NG19, and provide a cross reference to &#xA7; 80.371(a) for the list of available carrier frequencies. Also, NG19 applies to two services. Accordingly, in the bands 2107-2170 and 2194-2495 kHz, the Commission moves the reference to NG19 in the non-Federal Table from the right of the mobile except aeronautical mobile service (MS except AMS) allocation to the bottom of the cell. Because the Commission revises NG19, it also renumbers this footnote in frequency order as NG7.</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="62927">21. The Commission also notes that the band 2000-3000 kHz is listed in the Public Safety Pool Frequency Table in &#xA7; 90.20(c)(3) and that its use is restricted to fixed stations that operate in accordance with Limitation 75. The Commission further notes that only the bands 2107-2170 and 2194-2495 kHz in the U.S. Table contain the appropriate cross references in the FCC Rule Part Cross References column of the Allocation Table. Accordingly, for the band 2000-2065 kHz, the Commission adds &#x201C;Private Land Mobile (90)&#x201D; in the FCC Rule Part Cross References.</p>
          <br><p><b>The 7 MHz Realignment</b></p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="62927">22. On March 10, 2005, the Commission implemented pertinent allocation decisions from the World Radiocommunication Conference (Geneva, 2003) (WRC-03) and updated certain of its service Rules. One of the most significant decisions in that action was the 7 MHz Realignment. Because the 7 MHz Realignment transition period concluded on March 29, 2009, the Commission has taken several actions to simplify and finalize the allocation display in the bands that comprise 6.765-8.1 MHz.</p>
          <br><p><b>a. Non-Interference Basis (NIB) Operations in Eight HFBC Bands</b></p>
          <p id="p-30" data-page="62927">23. Until March 29, 2009, the band 7.35-7.4 MHz (<i>i.e.,</i> the upper half of the 7 MHz band) was allocated in all Regions to the FS and HFBC on a co-primary basis and to the land mobile service (LMS) on a secondary basis. The upper half of the 7 MHz band is now allocated to the HFBC on an exclusive basis throughout the world, except in those countries listed in RR 5.143C where the FS and the HFBC continue to be allocated on a co-primary basis.</p>
          <p id="p-31" data-page="62927">24. In this section, the Commission simplifies the authority for certain types of Federal and non-Federal stations to continue operating in eight HFBC bands in a manner that does not affect the ability of the general public in the United States to directly receive programming from international broadcast stations (NIB operations). Specifically, the Commission updates and consolidates the NIB authority for Federal stations in the FS to operate in 13 HF bands/sub-bands (HF NIB Bands), for Federal stations in the mobile except aeronautical mobile route (R) service (MS except AM(R)S) to also operate in 4 of these bands, and for grandfathered non-Federal stations to operate in certain of these bands.</p>

          <p id="p-32" data-page="62927">25. First, the Commission notes that non-Federal operations in the 13 HF NIB bands are currently authorized in 2 U.S. footnotes&#x2014;US366 and US396. Specifically, US366 restricts non-Federal use of the HF NIB Bands to stations in the FS and MS except AMS (<i>i.e.,</i> the LMS and the MMS) that were licensed prior to March 25, 2007. Given the existing non-Federal licensees in the HF NIB Bands that were licensed prior to March 25, 2007, US366 consequently authorizes the following non-Federal NIB operations: (1) MMS stations may continue operating in the bands 5.9-5.95, 13.57-13.6, 13.8-13.87, and 18.90-19.02 MHz (the 6, 13.6, 13.8, and 19 MHz bands), and in the band 7.3-7.35 MHz (<i>i.e.,</i> the lower half of the 7 MHz band); (2) FS and LMS stations may continue operating in the bands 7.3-7.35 MHz and 9.4-9.5 MHz (9 MHz); and (3) FS stations may continue operating in the bands 11.6-11.65, 12.05-12.1, 13.8-13.87, and 15.6-15.8 MHz (the 11, 12, 13.8, and 15 MHz bands). Further, US396 states that non-Federal use of the band 7.35-7.4 MHz (<i>i.e.,</i> the upper half of the 7 MHz band) is restricted to FS, LMS, and MMS stations that were licensed prior to March 29, 2009, except that a small sub-band at 7.3685-7.3713 MHz, within the upper half of the 7 MHz band, was not reallocated for exclusive HFBC use and is instead authorized for continued use by Alaska private-fixed stations.</p>

          <p id="p-33" data-page="62927">26. Second, the Commission notes that Federal NIB operations in the 13 HF NIB Bands are currently authorized in 3 U.S. footnotes&#x2014;US366, US367, and US396&#x2014;and that new Federal stations may be authorized in 10 of theses bands. Specifically, US366 authorizes Federal FS stations to operate in 10 of the 13 HF NIB Bands, i.e., the 6, 9, 11, 12, 13.6, 13.8, 15, and 19 MHz bands, in the band 7.3-7.35 MHz (the lower half of the 7 MHz band), and in the band 17.48-17.55 MHz (17 MHz). US366 also authorizes Federal stations in the MS except AMS (<i>i.e.,</i> the LMS and MMS) to operate in the 6, 13.6, and 13.8 MHz bands, and in the lower half of the 7 MHz band.</p>
          <p id="p-34" data-page="62927">27. Also, US367 authorizes Federal use of 3 of the 13 HF NIB Bands (9.775-9.9, 11.65-11.7, and 11.975-12.05 MHz). Specifically, Federal use of the band is restricted to FS stations that were authorized as of June 12, 2003, and each grandfathered station is restricted to a total radiated power of 24 dBW. Finally, US396 authorizes Federal stations in the FS, LMS, and MMS to operate in the upper half of the 7 MHz band.</p>

          <p id="p-35" data-page="62927">28. Accordingly, the Commission combines the text of US366, US367, and US396 into a single U.S. footnote that consolidates the authority for Federal
:::index 75p62928

and non-Federal stations to operate in the 13 HF NIB Bands. Consistent with our new footnote numbering policy, the Commission numbers this new U.S. footnote as US136.</p>
          <p id="p-36" data-page="62928">29. The Commission observes that non-Federal stations in the FS, LMS, and MMS will operate on a NIB to foreign-licensed international broadcast stations, irrespective of whether they are recognized in US136. The focus of the Commission&apos;s action here is to better inform NTIA of non-Federal incumbent operations in the HF NIB Bands, and thereby minimize the effort required to coordinate new Federal FS and MS except AM(R)S stations in those bands. Therefore, because our review revealed that non-Federal LMS stations operate in the 9 MHz band, the Commission lists this service in the consolidated text of US136 despite the fact that the 9 MHz band was never allocated to that service. In addition, because the review revealed that there is no longer any non-Federal FS or LMS stations operating in the 6 MHz band or any non-Federal FS stations operating in the 13.8 MHz band, the Commission revised the consolidated text in US136 by removing these unused non-Federal allocations.</p>

          <p id="p-37" data-page="62928">30. At the request of NTIA, the Commission revises the consolidated text in US136 in order to reflect the full range of Federal NIB assignments in the 6, 7, 13.6, and 13.8 MHz bands. Specifically, NTIA states that: The United States sought and obtained explicit authority in the ITU <i>Radio Regulations</i> (<i>see</i> RR 5.136 and RR 5.151) to operate stations in the FS and MS except AM(R)S in these bands; and the United States&apos; right to operate stations in the MS except AM(R)S in the 7 MHz band on a NIB to HFBC is internationally recognized in ITU Radio Regulation No. 4.4. Because such operations by their nature do not affect non-Federal stations, the Commission concludes that this editorial revision promotes clarity by stating in the consolidated text of US136 that Federal stations in the MS except AM(R)S currently operate in the 6, 7, 13.6, and 13.8 MHz bands and that NTIA can authorize new Federal stations in the MS except AM(R)S in these bands.</p>

          <p id="p-38" data-page="62928">31. As an aid to readers, the Commission revises the consolidated text in US136 as follows: In paragraph (a), we reflect the Commission&apos;s previous decision to alternatively allocate a small sub-band (<i>i.e.,</i> the &#x201C;assigned frequency band&#x201D; 7368.48-7371.32 kHz) within the upper 7 MHz band for continued use by Alaska private-fixed stations. In paragraph (b), we reflect the requirements that pertain to NIB use of the HFBC bands. In paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), respectively, the Commission lists the restrictions that apply to Federal stations and non-Federal stations operating in the 13 HF NIB bands. The Commission also includes a table that lists the authorized Federal and non-Federal uses of the 13 HF NIB bands. Finally, the Commission removes the text of two expired U.S. footnotes&#x2014;US394 and US395&#x2014;from &#xA7; 2.106 of the Commission&apos;s rules.</p>
          <br><p><b>b. Amateur Radio Service and International Broadcast Stations</b></p>
          <p id="p-39" data-page="62928">32. <i>40-meter band.</i> Because the 7 MHz Realignment transition period has concluded, the Commission replaces RR 5.142 (which contains an expired requirement regarding use of the band 7.1-7.2 MHz) in the U.S. Table with a new U.S. footnote that contains only the current requirement in RR 5.142 (&#x201C;The use of the band 7.2-7.3 MHz in Region 2 by the amateur service shall not impose constraints on the broadcasting service intended for use within Region 1 and Region 3.&#x201D;). Consequently, the Commission numbers this new footnote as US142, which places it in frequency order and links it to the related international footnote RR 5.142. Also, in the FCC Rule Part Cross References column of the Allocation Table, the Commission changes all instances of &#x201C;Amateur (97)&#x201D; to read &#x201C;Amateur Radio (97).&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="p-40" data-page="62928">33. <i>HFBC.</i> The Commission also highlight that, in the Region 3 insular areas, the bands 7.2-7.3 and 7.4-7.45 MHz are alternatively allocated for use by international broadcast stations that transmit their programming to listeners in Region 1 and Region 3 by reflecting this allocation from the Region 3 Table in new US142 and by separating these bands from the larger bands 7.1-7.3 and 7.4-8.1 MHz in the U.S. Table. The Commission takes this action because U.S. international broadcast stations regularly operate in these areas and because it allows us to highlight in the FCC Rule Part Cross References column that, in the U.S. Region 3 insular areas, the bands 7.2-7.3 and 7.4-7.45 MHz are available for licensing under part 73, subpart F (<i>i.e.,</i> international broadcast stations). In addition, as a consequence of the conclusion of the 7 MHz Realignment, we update &#xA7; 73.702(f)-(h) to reflect the availability of spectrum for international broadcast stations.</p>
          <p id="p-41" data-page="62928">34. In a related matter, the Commission simplifies the display of 14 HFBC bands in the U.S. Table by merging adjacent bands, which differ only by footnote references, to form 6 larger bands. In the FCC Rule Part Cross References column, the Commission replaces all instances of &#x201C;Radio Broadcast (HF)(73)&#x201D; with &#x201C;International Broadcast Stations (73F)&#x201D; in order to better highlight the availability of the spectrum for international broadcasting use.</p>
          <br><p><b>Preferred Frequencies for Disaster and Long Distance Communications</b></p>

          <p id="p-42" data-page="62928">35. In the Public Safety Pool Frequency Table, the use of frequencies in the band 2000 to 10,000 kHz (<i>i.e.,</i> 2-10 MHz) is restricted to disaster communications and operational communications circuits are expressly prohibited. Only the central governments of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. insular areas are eligible to use this spectrum. Section 90.264, <i>inter alia,</i> restricts disaster communications to those bands between 2 and 10 MHz that are allocated to the FS and LMS. By Public Notice, the Commission specified 28 carrier frequencies and their associated assigned frequencies as available for use in accordance with &#xA7; 90.264 for disaster communications between 2 and 10 MHz.</p>
          <p id="p-43" data-page="62928">36. The use of these 28 disaster frequencies is restricted in the Public Notice by power (1 kW peak envelope power (PEP)), emission type (2K80J3E), and class of station (fixed stations may operate on all frequencies; base and land mobile stations may also operate on the lowest 18 frequencies). Also, although 17 of the frequencies are available without geographic, purpose, or time restrictions, the Public Notice further restricted 11 of the disaster frequencies either by geographic scope (1 of the &#x201C;Day only&#x201D; use frequencies is available only for stations that are located in the conterminous U.S.), for a specific purpose (5 frequencies are designated as &#x201C;alternate&#x201D; and 5 frequencies are designated for &#x201C;interstate coordination&#x201D;), or by time of day (2 frequencies are available for &#x201C;Day only&#x201D; use). The Commission observes that NTIA agreed to nationwide non-Federal use of the 28 disaster frequencies in 1980, and thus, the Commission has not coordinated non-Federal use of these frequencies for approximately 28 years.</p>

          <p id="p-44" data-page="62928">37. In the Industrial/Business Pool Frequency Table, the use of frequencies in the band 2000 to 25,000 kHz (<i>i.e.,</i> 2-25 MHz) is restricted to the purposes specified in Limitation 1, which is a cross reference to 47 CFR 90.35(c)(1), and by class of station(s) (fixed, base, or mobile). In addition, &#xA7; 90.266, <i>inter alia,</i> restricts the use of any particular frequency between 2 and 25 MHz to those bands that are allocated to the FS and LMS.

          </p>
          <p id="p-45" data-page="62929">38. By Public Notice, the Commission specified 40 carrier frequencies and their associated assigned frequencies in 6 bands (2194-2495 kHz; 3.155-3.4, 4.438-4.65, 5.005-5.45, 6.765-7, and 7.3-8.1 MHz) that are available for part 90 long distance communications. (The Commission notes that the band 7.3-7.4 MHz has since been reallocated to the HFBC.) The Public Notice specifies each frequency&apos;s station class (fixed stations may operate on all frequencies; land mobile and base stations may also operate on the 13 lowest frequencies; and itinerant fixed stations may also operate on the 27 highest frequencies) and that these stations do not require coordination with NTIA as long as the transmitter power does not exceed 1 kW PEP. In addition, these stations&apos; emissions are limited to emission type 2K80J3E and as specified in &#xA7; 90.266. Also, although 20 frequencies are available to these stations without time or geographic restrictions, the Commission restricted the use of the remaining 20 frequencies. Specifically, the Public Notice restricts 8 frequencies by time of day (1 frequency is for &#x201C;Day only&#x201D; use and 7 are for &#x201C;Night only&#x201D; use) and restricts 13 frequencies by geographic scope (5 frequencies are for stations located East of 108&#xB0; West Longitude (approximately the Continental Divide), 1 frequency is for stations located West of the Mississippi River, and 7 frequencies are for stations located West of 90&#xB0; West Longitude).</p>
          <p id="p-46" data-page="62929">39. The Commission has discussed this matter with NTIA, and it is our joint conclusion that, because it has not been necessary to revise the lists of available frequencies since 1980, we should reflect these important and long-standing uses in the Allocation Table. Accordingly, the Commission reflect these frequencies in the Allocation Table by reproducing the list of 68 carrier frequencies and the restrictions on their use in a new U.S. footnote, which we number as US22. The Commission anticipates that most, if not all, non-Federal requirements for disaster and long distance communications can be met using these channels. In sum, this action is expected to be helpful to applicants by highlighting the availability of these frequencies and it in no way limits the Commission&apos;s ability to coordinate the use of other frequencies in the Federal/non-Federal shared bands with NTIA.</p>
          <br><p><b>Power Line Carrier Systems</b></p>

          <p id="p-47" data-page="62929">40. The Commission revises the text of US294 and a related reference in part 90 of the Commission&apos;s rules in order to clearly define the band within which Power Line Carriers (PLCs) must be coordinated in order to protect licensed stations, <i>i.e.,</i> the band 9-490 kHz. The Commission notes that this action is consistent with &#xA7; 15.113(b), which states that: &#x201C;The signals from this [PLC] operation shall be contained within the frequency band 9 kHz to 490 kHz.&#x201D; The Commission also updates a cross reference in part 15 of the Commission&apos;s rules. Specifically, the Commission revises: US294 by replacing the phrases &#x201C;spectrum below 490 kHz&#x201D; and &#x201C;bands below 490 kHz&#x201D; with the phrase &#x201C;band 9-490 kHz&#x201D; and by updating the PLC cross reference to the <i>NTIA Manual</i> from Chapter 7 to Chapter 8; &#xA7; 90.35(g) by replacing the phrase &#x201C;10-490 kHz&#x201D; in the first sentence with the phrase &#x201C;9-490 kHz;&#x201D; and &#xA7; 15.5(a) and 15.113(a) by updating the cross reference from &#x201C;&#xA7; 90.63(g)&#x201D; to &#x201C;&#xA7; 90.35(g).&#x201D; Because the Commission revises US294, it renumbers this footnote in frequency order as US2.</p>

The pre-WRC-07 version of RR 5.226 states that the frequency 156.8 MHz is the international distress, safety, and calling frequency for the maritime mobile VHF radiotelephone service and that the conditions for its use are contained in Article 31. In addition, a 75-kilohertz band centered on 156.8 MHz (<i>i.e.,</i> the band 156.7625-156.8375 MHz) is allocated exclusively for this purpose in all Regions (<i>i.e.,</i> the normal 25-kilohertz channel bandwidth that is authorized in the MMS is protected from harmful interference via the use of 25 kilohertz of guard-band spectrum on each side of the 25-kilohertz channel).</p>

In addition, NTIA recommends that the list of internationally permitted operations (<i>i.e.,</i> distress and calling communications) on 156.8 MHz be expanded by also listing urgency and safety. Specifically, NTIA notes that, consistent with Article 53 of the ITU <i>Radio Regulations,</i> urgency and safety communications are permitted in the 75-kilohertz band centered at 156.8 MHz, and thus, these uses should also be listed in the parenthetical restrictions on transmissions to this MMS allocation.</p>

          <p id="p-54" data-page="62929">46. Because the 75-kilohertz band centered on 156.8 MHz has been allocated to the MMS on a primary, exclusive, and worldwide basis for distress and calling purposes since 1979, the Commission concludes that further aligning the U.S. Table with the International Table would be consistent with the Commission&apos;s established policy. A search of the Commission&apos;s licensing database showed that the 75-kilohertz band centered on 156.8 MHz is licensed to coast and ship stations, except for stations operating under four call signs, which are authorized on an unprotected and non-interference basis. Since the 75-kilohertz band at 156.8 MHz is not encumbered with other allocated services, displaying that band in the U.S. Table would be equivalent to our current footnote allocation. Thus, the Commission finds it would be appropriate to simplify the U.S. Table by mirroring the international table. Accordingly, the Commission reflects in the U.S. Table the primary MMS allocation in the band 156.7625-156.8375 MHz, which is restricted to distress, urgency, safety, and calling transmissions. Consequently, the

          <br><p><b>b. Automatic Identification System</b></p>

          <p id="p-55" data-page="62930">47. In September, 2008, the Commission adopted &#x201C;additional measures for domestic implementation of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), an advanced marine vessel tracking and navigation technology that can significantly enhance our Nation&apos;s homeland security as well as maritime safety.&#x201D; With regard to that <i>Order,</i> the most significant decisions were to: &#x201C;Designate maritime VHF Channel 87B for exclusive AIS use throughout the Nation;&#x201D; and &#x201C;determine that only Federal Government (Federal) entities should have authority to operate AIS base stations.&#x201D; In addition, in accordance with the Maritime Transportation Security Act, the Commission specified that the United States Coast Guard (USCG) regulates AIS carriage requirements for non-Federal ships.</p>

          <p id="p-56" data-page="62930">48. At the request of NTIA, the Commission highlights the two AIS frequencies&#x2014;161.975 MHz (AIS 1) and 162.025 MHz (AIS 2)&#x2014;by directly reflecting in the U.S. Table the MMS allocation for these frequencies and the restrictions on their use contained in US399. In addition, the Commission simplifies and clarifies US399 by consolidating part of the grandfathering text in an introductory phrase and by adding paragraph labeling for each of the grandfathering cases. Consistent with our new footnote numbering policy discussed, the Commission also renumbers US399 in frequency order as US228. As a result, the U.S. Table now displays two 25-kilohertz bands centered on AIS 1 and AIS 2, respectively, (<i>i.e.,</i> 161.9625-161.9875 and 162.0125-162.0375 MHz), in combined Federal/non-Federal cells within the U.S. Table with the entry &#x201C;MARITIME MOBILE (AIS) US228.&#x201D;</p>
          <br><p><b>Radiolocation Band Display Changes</b></p>

          <p id="p-57" data-page="62930">49. In this section, the Commission simplifies and corrects the display of the band 216-225 MHz in the U.S. Table. As background, in the Region 2 Table, the band 216-225 MHz is allocated, <i>inter alia,</i> to the radiolocation service (RLS) on a secondary basis and RR 5.241 further restricts the use of this allocation to RLS stations that were authorized prior to January 1, 1990.</p>
          <p id="p-58" data-page="62930">50. <i>US229.</i> During the coordination process, NTIA advised us that, because RR 5.241 prohibits any new RLS stations from being authorized in the band 216-225 MHz, Federal RLS use of that band is necessarily limited to those stations authorized pursuant to US229 and to air-search radars aboard USCG vessels that transmit on 220 MHz with a necessary bandwidth of 70 kHz (i.e., these emissions occupy the sub-band 219.965-220.035 MHz). Therefore, NTIA requests that the Commission remove the secondary Federal radiolocation service allocation in the bands 216-217 MHz and 220-225 MHz from the Federal Table and list the 70 kilohertz band that is used by the USCG in US229. As a result of removing the RLS allocation entry from the Federal Table, the Federal and non-Federal Tables are exactly the same for the band 220-222 MHz. Accordingly, the Commission listed the allocations and footnotes in this band once in a combined U.S. Table entry. The Commission also updated and revises US229 for clarity, consistency, and simplicity. Because of the revision to US229, the Commission renumbers this footnote with a number&#x2014;US241&#x2014;that is based on the related international footnote RR 5.241.</p>
          <br><p><b>Fixed and Land Mobile Bands Display Changes</b></p>
          <p id="p-59" data-page="62930">51. <i>US335.</i> In order to improve the readability of US335, which sub-divides the band 220-222 MHz into seven paired bands (one Federal exclusive band, four non-Federal exclusive bands, and two shared bands), the Commission places the bands in a table, list the bands in frequency order, and add four headings (Use, Base Transmit, Mobile Transmit, and Channel Nos.). The Commission also reproduced certain information from &#xA7;&#xA7; 90.715, 90.720, and 90.719 in new paragraphs (a), (c), and (d), respectively, in order to provide a basic understanding of the national plan for 220 MHz and to make it clear that the use of 10 shared channels (Channels 161-170) is restricted to public safety/mutual aid communications and that the use of 5 shared channels (Channels 181-185) is restricted to emergency medical communications. In addition, the Commission moved the existing provision in US335 for temporary fixed geophysical telemetry operations to paragraph (b). Because of the revision to US335, the Commission renumbers this footnote in frequency order as US242.</p>

          <br><p><b>Non-Federal Use of Military Radar Band 420-450 MHz</b></p>

          <p id="p-60" data-page="62930">52. The Commission addressed several issues related to the band 420-450 MHz, which is allocated to the Federal radiolocation service on a primary basis. Under G2, NTIA has restricted the use of this allocation to the military services, except as provided for in US217 and G129. Although the band 420-450 MHz (70-centimeter (cm) band) is allocated to the amateur service on a secondary basis, the band 420-430 MHz is not allocated to the amateur service North of Line A. Amateur stations may transmit in the 70-cm band at full power (<i>i.e.,</i> transmitter power may not exceed 1.5 kW PEP), except in the areas specified in US7, where transmitter power is generally restricted to 50 W PEP. NTIA has informed us that, due to the light Federal use of the authority provided for in US217, this footnote should be restricted to non-Federal use only. Specifically, NTIA determined that non-military use of the band 420-450 MHz is sufficiently infrequent that it prefers to manage this military band by accepting waivers of G2 from non-military users. As a consequence of its decision, NTIA requested that the Commission revise G2 by removing the reference to US217.</p>
          <p id="p-61" data-page="62930">53. <i>Non-Federal Radiolocation.</i> At the request of NTIA, the Commission simplifies US217 by restricting its applicability to non-Federal use. In addition, in order to simplify the rules and ensure that geographic areas listed in this footnote are consistent with those listed in US7 (which we combine with NG135 and renumber as US270), the Commission removed the geographic areas currently listed in US217 and replaced them with a cross reference to paragraph (a) of the consolidated footnote US270. For ease of use, the Commission also renumbered US217 as US269 so that the referenced geographic areas can be easily found in adjacent US270. In order to accomplish this advantageous renumbering, the Commission added the current text of US269, which urges fixed and mobile except aeronautical mobile licensees in the 2655-2690 MHz band to coordinate their systems, along with the secondary allocation status of the radio astronomy service in the 2655-2690 MHz band that is shown in the U.S. Table, to US311, and renumbered US311 as US385.</p>
          <p id="p-62" data-page="62930">54. <i>70-cm Amateur Radio Service Band.</i> In order to consolidate all of the restrictions on amateur radio service operations in the band 420-450 MHz in one footnote, the Commission combined the text from US7 and NG135 into a single U.S. footnote, which is renumbered as US270. The Commission chose to number the consolidated footnote as US270 because RR 5.270 contains the secondary amateur service allocation for the bands 420-430 and 440-450 MHz in the United States and three other countries.

          <p id="p-63" data-page="62931">55. In preparing this Order, the Commission discovered that the reference to NG12 in the band 456-460 MHz is missing from the non-Federal Table. Therefore, the Commission takes this opportunity to correct this omission by reinserting the reference to NG12 in the band 456-460 MHz in the non-Federal Table.</p>
          <br><p><b>MED Channels</b></p>
          <p id="p-64" data-page="62931">56. <i>Medical Radiocommunication Systems.</i> In order to properly reflect the channeling plan used by medical radiocommunication systems, which consists of 40 channel pairs and is codified in paragraphs (d)(65) and (d)(66) of &#xA7; 90.20 (commonly known as the MED channels), the Commission revises US216 by adjusting the bandwidths of the two bands that are specified for use by medical radiocommunication systems. Specifically, it replaces the bands 462.94688-463.19688 MHz and 467.94688-468.19688 MHz in US216 with the bands 462.94-463.19675 MHz and 467.94-468.19675 MHz, respectively. Thus, the Commission renumbers US216 as US73.</p>
          <br><p><b>Television Bands</b></p>
          <p id="p-65" data-page="62931">57. <i>NG128 and NG142.</i> NG128 and NG142 authorize ancillary uses of TV Channels 2-36 and 38-69. Specifically, NG128 authorizes, <i>inter alia,</i> TV broadcast licensees or permittees to use subcarriers on a secondary basis for both broadcast and non-broadcast purposes. NG142 states that TV broadcast stations may use a portion of the television vertical blanking interval for the transmission of telecommunications signals, on the condition that harmful interference will not be caused to the reception of primary services, and that such telecommunications services must accept any interference caused by primary services operating in these bands. The bands 698-763, 775-793, and 805-806 MHz&#x2014;which are allocated to the fixed, mobile, and broadcasting services&#x2014;are regulated under part 27 and have been auctioned for Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) use. To the extent that these part 27 licensees choose to implement the uses specified in NG128 and NG142, they may do so under their primary FS allocation. Accordingly, the Commission removed the band 698-806 MHz from NG128 and NG142. For clarity, it also amended NG128 by revising &#x201C;licensees or permittees&#x201D; (three instances) to read &#x201C;licensees and permittees.&#x201D; Because the Commission revised NG128 and NG142, it renumbers these footnotes in frequency order as NG5 and NG14, respectively.</p>
          <br><p><b>Public Safety Bands</b></p>
          <p id="p-66" data-page="62931">58. The Commission reflects the availability of certain public safety bands in the Allocation Table. This action is taken in order to assist both non-Federal applicants and sponsored Federal agencies, and to facilitate the rapid conclusion of the 800 MHz-band transition.</p>
          <p id="p-67" data-page="62931">59. Section 2.103(b) of the Commission&apos;s rules states that Federal stations may be authorized to use frequencies in specified 700 MHz, 800 MHz, and 4.9 GHz Bands that are allocated for exclusive non-Federal use if the Commission finds that such use is necessary and Federal operations are in accordance with the Commission&apos;s rules governing the service to which the frequencies involved are allocated. In 1998, the Commission concluded that Federal entities are ineligible for Commission licensing in the 700 MHz Public Safety Band, but found that &#x201C;if a state or local governmental licensee desires for a Federal public safety entity to receive access to some or all of its licensed frequencies, the licensee can join in the request, under the NTIA/FCC process, to authorize Federal use of its non-government frequencies for noncommercial public safety services.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="p-68" data-page="62931">60. In July 2004, the Commission adopted the <i>800 MHz R&amp;O,</i> which reconfigured the 800 MHz band for private radio services that operate in the paired bands 806-824/851-869 MHz. In general, the <i>800 MHz R&amp;O</i> moved a dedicated public safety band (generally known as the National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) Band) from 821-824/866-869 MHz to 806-809/851-854 MHz; and established a contiguous block of paired spectrum for Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR) use at 817-824/862-869 MHz, which the Commission licensed to Nextel (now Sprint Nextel).</p>
          <p id="p-69" data-page="62931">61. Accordingly, the Commission revises how the part 90 cross references in the 700 MHz, NPSPAC, and 4.9 GHz bands are displayed in column six of the Allocation Table in order to reflect that the Public Safety Land Mobile Radio Service (PSLMRS) is the specific Private Land Mobile Radio Service that is designated to use these bands and that part 90 specifies certain portions of these bands for PSLMRS operations. In order to better assist Federal agencies, we also highlight the 700 MHz and NPSPAC bands in the Federal Table by subdividing the band 698-890 MHz into nine smaller bands (698-763, 763-775, 775-793, 793-805, 805-806, 806-809, 809-851, 851-854, and 854-890 MHz). The Commission declines to add a U.S. footnote that would point to &#xA7; 2.102 at this time.</p>
          <br><p><b>U.S. Footnote Changes in the Band 1390-1432 MHz</b></p>
          <p id="p-70" data-page="62931">62. The Commission makes several changes to the bands that comprise 1390-1432 MHz. First, at the request of NTIA, it updates US351 by removing the expired authority for Federal stations to operate in the band 1390-1400 MHz on a fully protected basis at 17 sites. In doing so, the Commission notes that the text of updated US351 and the existing text of US352 are essentially identical. Therefore, it combined the explicit authority for Federal NIB operations to continue in the band 1390-1400 MHz (US351) and in the band 1427-1432 MHz (US352) into a single U.S. footnote (US37). The Commission also noted that Federal agencies may, without further authority from NTIA, purchase and operate Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) devices that have been certified by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission updates the parenthetical exception text to better reflect the Commission&apos;s decision that although the bands 1390-1400 and 1427-1432 MHz were transferred for non-Federal exclusive use, Federal hospitals have access to the WMTS bands on a primary basis as end users.</p>
          <p id="p-71" data-page="62931">63. In the <i>WRC-03 Omnibus R&amp;O,</i> the Commission inadvertently removed the reference to US74 from the band 1400-1427 MHz in the U.S. Table. Therefore, it takes this opportunity to correct this error by reinserting the reference to US74 in the band 1400-1427 MHz.</p>

          <br><p><b>GOES Footnote</b></p>

          <p id="p-72" data-page="62931">64. Because the band 7190-7235 MHz is allocated for exclusive Federal use, in support of the Department of Commerce&apos;s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), NTIA added a new Federal footnote&#x2014;G134&#x2014;to the <i>NTIA Manual</i> in its September 2008 revision. Because Federal footnotes denote stipulations applicable only to Federal operations, and the Federal Table is included in the Allocation Table for informational purposes only, adding G134 to the Federal Table is a non-substantive, editorial action. Therefore, the Commission added G134 to the Federal Table.

          <br><p><b>Ku-Band Fixed-Satellite Service</b></p>
          <p id="p-73" data-page="62932">65. In the United States, the band 11.7-12.2 GHz is allocated to the non-Federal fixed-satellite service (FSS) for space-to-Earth transmissions (downlinks). The Commission observed that NG145 and RR 5.485 contain the exact same text, except that RR 5.485 opens with the phrase &#x201C;In Region 2&#x201D;. The Commission&apos;s rules specify that where an international footnote is applicable, without modification, to non-Federal operations, it is placed in the non-Federal Table. Accordingly, we correct the band 11.7-12.2 GHz in the non-Federal Table by replacing NG145 with RR 5.485.</p>

          <p id="p-74" data-page="62932">66. The Commission also notes that, in the Region 2 Table, RR 5.485 is shown at the bottom of the cell in the bands 11.7-12.1 and 12.1-12.2 GHz. Consistent with the Commission&apos;s current display of NG145, however, it places RR 5.485 to the right of the non-Federal FSS downlink allocation because this international footnote provides the licensees of FSS space stations with additional flexibility, but does not provide for a separate allocation, <i>i.e.,</i> the Commission would not authorize a space station in the broadcasting-satellite service under this international footnote. Also, consistent with the Region 2 Table, the Commission corrects a display error by moving the reference to 5.488 from the bottom of the cell in the band 11.7-12.2 GHz to the right of the non-Federal FSS downlink allocation.</p>
          <br><p><b>H. Updates to Other Rule Sections</b></p>
          <br><p><b>Adding Inter-Satellite Service Bands to Part 25</b></p>

          <p id="p-75" data-page="62932">67. The Commission makes a conforming modification to its part 25 satellite rules. On December 19, 2000, the Commission realigned the allocations in the bands 50.2-50.4 and 51.4-71 GHz. As part of this realignment, the Commission provided separate inter-satellite service (ISS) allocations for Federal agencies and for non-Federal (commercial) licensees by allocating the band 65-71 GHz to the non-Federal ISS, deleting the non-Federal ISS allocation from the bands 56.9-57 and 59-64 GHz, and allocating the band 64-65 GHz to the Federal ISS. The remaining ISS allocations in this frequency range (54.25-56.9 and 57-58.2 GHz) are available for both Federal and non-Federal use. Note that the Commission adopted this plan at the request of NTIA, industry commenters supported the plan, and that &#xA7;&#xA7; 25.202(b) and 25.279 of the Commission&apos;s rules already permit the use of these ISS allocations. Accordingly, the Commission adds the bands 54.25-56.9, 57-58.2, and 65-71 GHz to the list of available ISS frequencies set forth in &#xA7; 25.202(a)(5) to conform to the Commission&apos;s 2000 decision. Consequently, the Commission also adds a cross reference to these rules in the FCC rule part cross references portion of the Allocation Table, <i>i.e.,</i>&#x201C;Satellite Communications (25).&#x201D;</p>
          <br><p><b>Revisions of Parts 1 and 2</b></p>

          <p id="p-76" data-page="62932">68. The Commission revised &#xA7;&#xA7; 1.924(b)(3) and (e)(1), 2.1(c), 2.100, 2.101(b), 2.104(c)(2), and 2.201(b). In addition, it makes various other minor revisions to &#xA7; 2.106. These revisions are generally for footnote placement, simplification, consistency, or updating purposes. In addition, on January 12, 2010, NTIA informed the Commission that G124 had been deleted from the <i>NTIA Manual</i> and requested that the Commission update its Allocation Table to reflect this action. As requested, the Commission removed the reference to G124 from &#xA7; 2.106 in this Order. The Commission also corrects a typographical error in US378. Specifically, in the middle of the table in US378, above the bottom seven listed locations, the Commission inserted the heading &#x201C;50 km radius of operation centered on.&#x201D; The Commission shows updated cross references in the FCC Rule Part Cross References in Table A6 in Appendix A of the released Order.</p>
