</b></p>

          <p id="p-6" data-page="12913">DoD, GSA, and NASA published an interim rule in the <span>Federal Register</span> at <!!ln dp_fr76 76-FR-18304p76 #76-FR-18304p76>76 FR 18304 on April 1, 2011, to implement the Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations at 13 CFR part 127 and the procedures authorized under section 8(m) of the Small Business Act, 85, (15 U.S.C. 637(m)). Seven respondents submitted comments on the interim rule. All respondents expressed support for the WOSB Program; however, some revisions to the WOSB Program were recommended. This final rule incorporates changes made in response to public comments as well as minor technical corrections.
:::index 79p12914


          </p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="12914">On December 21, 2000, Congress enacted the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 (Act), (Pub. L. 106-554). Section 811 of Appendix I of the Act amended the Small Business Act to provide for a procurement program for women-owned small business concerns. Today, this program is known as the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program. The purpose of the WOSB Program is to ensure that women-owned small business concerns have an equal opportunity to participate in Federal contracting and to assist agencies in achieving their women-owned small business concern participation goals.</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="12914">Under the WOSB Program, contracting officers may restrict competition for Federal contracts to small business concerns owned and controlled by women, under certain conditions, including but not limited to: (1) The procurement requirement is in an industry the SBA has determined to be underrepresented or substantially underrepresented by small business concerns owned and controlled by women; and (2) small business concerns owned and controlled by women participating in the WOSB Program have met the Program&apos;s eligibility requirements. The contracting officer must expect that two or more concerns will submit offers; contract award will be made at a fair and reasonable price; and the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $6.5 million in the case of a contract assigned a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for manufacturing, or $4 million, in the case of all other contracts. These figures are higher than the statute and SBA regulation figures because they are adjusted for inflation (see FAR 1.109).</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="12914">Section 3(n) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(n)) broadly defines a small business concern owned and controlled by women as one that is at least 51 percent owned by one or more women (or in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of the stock is owned by one or more women) and whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more women. The Governmentwide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by women is 5 percent of the total value of all prime and subcontract awards (15 U.S.C. 644(g)). However, not all small business concerns owned and controlled by women are eligible to participate in the WOSB Program set forth in section 8(m) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(m)).</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="12914">The SBA established detailed criteria at 13 CFR 127.200, 127.201, 127.202, and 127.203 for the women-owned small businesses authorized under the Act to participate in the Program: EDWOSB concerns and WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program. In contrast with the broader definition for women-owned small businesses provided at 15 U.S.C. 632(n), both EDWOSB concerns and WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program must be no less than 51 percent unconditionally and directly owned by one or more women who are United States citizens. (Other WOSB Program-specific eligibility criteria are set forth in the SBA&apos;s regulations and FAR subpart 19.15.) Thus, EDWOSB concerns and WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program are actually subcategories of the larger group of women-owned small business concerns.</p>
          
<br><p><b>II. Discussion and Analysis 
</b></p>

          <p id="p-11" data-page="12914">The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (the Councils) reviewed the public comments in the development of the final rule. A discussion of the comments and the changes made to the rule as a result of those comments are provided as follows:</p>
          <br><p><b>A. Changes From the Interim Rule</b></p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="12914">This final rule makes minor changes to the interim rule. The term &#x201C;WOSB concern&#x201D; is corrected to &#x201C;WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program&#x201D; in the FAR and in the Standard Forms. The relevant Paperwork Reduction Act burden control number is added to the list at FAR 1.106.</p>
          <br><p><b>B. Analysis of Public Comments</b></p>
          <br><p><b>1. The WOSB Program Should Be Modeled After Current SBA Programs</b></p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="12914">
            <i>Comment:</i> One respondent commented that the WOSB Program should be modeled after current SBA programs and require either a self-certification or an SBA Certification where eligibility appears on the firm&apos;s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) profiles.</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="12914">
            <i>Response:</i> The WOSB Program adheres to the authorizing statute, section 811 of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, Public Law 106-554, and SBA regulations. The statute permits both self-certifications by the concern and third-party certification from an entity approved by the SBA. In the SBA final rule the supporting legislative history stated that there was no intent to create a certification program similar to the one for the section 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>
          <br><p><b>2. The WOSB Program Repository Is Burdensome</b></p>
          <p id="p-15" data-page="12914">
            <i>Comment:</i> One respondent commented that the WOSB Program Repository is burdensome and to have companies register in CCR, ORCA and then a third system seems extraneous.</p>
          <p id="p-16" data-page="12914">
            <i>Response:</i> The WOSB Program Repository is SBA&apos;s solution to facilitate the statutory requirement to provide documents verifying program eligibility. SBA established the repository so that WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program and EDWOSB concerns would not have to submit documents each time they are the apparent successful offeror. The WOSB Program repository minimizes paperwork burden and increases oversight and program monitoring capabilities.</p>
          <br><p><b>3. The WOSB Program Requirement To Submit Additional (and Sensitive) Documents Could Create a Disincentive for the Use of the Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-17" data-page="12914">
            <i>Comment:</i> One respondent commented that the WOSB Program&apos;s requirement to submit personal information and the additional reviews on behalf of the Government might create a disincentive to utilize the program and contracting authority to the fullest extent possible.</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="12914">
            <i>Response:</i> The certification and additional documentation requirements are necessary to meet the statutory provisions and regulatory requirements of the WOSB Program, and to ensure that only WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program receive the benefits of the WOSB Program.</p>
          <br><p><b>4. Dollar Thresholds and Eligibility Requirements</b></p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="12914">
            <i>Comment:</i> One respondent commented that the WOSB Program&apos;s EDWOSB limits and eligibility requirements need to be re-evaluated as the $750,000.00 threshold may be too low.</p>
          <p id="p-20" data-page="12914">
            <i>Response:</i> The $750,000 personal net worth requirement was established by the SBA. See the SBA regulation at 13 CFR 127.203 for limitations and for exclusions, <i>e.g.,</i> primary personal residence, ownership interest in the EDWOSB concern, and retirement accounts.</p>
          <br><p><b>5. Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program for WOSB Program</b></p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="12914">
            <i>Comment:</i> One respondent commented that the Councils should consider a Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program for the WOSB Program. Such a program
:::index 79p12915

already exists for the section 8(a) program. A Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program would allow women-owned small businesses to learn from larger, more successful businesses.</p>
          <p id="p-22" data-page="12915">
            <i>Response:</i> Under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, Public Law 111-240, SBA was given the authority to establish mentor-prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; programs for small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, small business concerns owned and controlled by women, and HUBZone small business concerns modeled on the Mentor-Prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; Program of the SBA for small business concerns participating in programs under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p>
          <br><p><b>6. Order of Precedence Among the WOSB Program and Other Small Business and Socioeconomic Contracting Programs</b></p>
          <p id="p-23" data-page="12915">
            <i>Comment:</i> One respondent commented that the interim rule implementing the WOSB Program did not revise FAR 19.203(c) to include WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program in the list of programs to be considered before using a small business set-aside pursuant to FAR 19.502-2(b). The interim rule, therefore, creates some uncertainty as to whether a contracting officer must first consider an acquisition under section 8(a), HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business programs before he or she can properly set-aside an acquisition for competition among WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program or EDWOSB concerns.</p>
          <p id="p-24" data-page="12915">
            <i>Response:</i> The interim rule did revise FAR 19.203(c) by adding WOSB programs.</p>
          <br><p><b>7. &#x201C;WOSB Concern&#x201D; Is Used Interchangeably With &#x201C;WOSB Concerns Eligible Under the WOSB Program&#x201D;</b></p>
          <p id="p-25" data-page="12915">
            <i>Comment:</i> One respondent commented that FAR subpart 19.15 appears to use the term &#x201C;WOSB concern&#x201D; interchangeably with &#x201C;WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program.&#x201D; This is potentially confusing and may lead to a misrepresentation of eligibility by a non-eligible WOSB concern.</p>
          <p id="p-26" data-page="12915">
            <i>Response:</i> Where applicable, for clarity and consistency, references to WOSB concern were revised to add &#x201C;eligible under the WOSB Program.&#x201D;</p>
          <br><p><b>8. Clarification Is Needed To Differentiate Between Eligibility Under the WOSB Program and Eligibility as a WOSB in General</b></p>
          <p id="p-27" data-page="12915">
            <i>Comment:</i> One respondent commented that the terms &#x201C;Women-Owned Small Business Concern&#x201D; and &#x201C;Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Concern Eligible under the WOSB Program&#x201D; (in accordance with 13 CFR 127) should be clarified. It was further suggested that the legislative and regulatory history for these definitions should be provided in the Background section of the <span>Federal Register</span>.</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="12915">
            <i>Response:</i> The &#x201C;Background&#x201D; of this final rule provides a brief legislative and regulatory history for the definitions of &#x201C;Women-Owned Small Business Concern&#x201D; and &#x201C;Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Concern Eligible under the WOSB Program.&#x201D; A more expansive historical perspective can be found in the SBA&apos;s proposed rule published in the <span>Federal Register</span> at <!!ln dp_fr75 75-FR-10030p75 #75-FR-10030p75>75 FR 10030 on March 4, 2010, and final rule published in the <span>Federal Register</span> at <!!ln dp_fr75 75-FR-62258p75 #75-FR-62258p75>75 FR 62258 on October 7, 2010.</p>
          <br><p><b>C. Other changes</b></p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="12915">Other changes include a minor revision to the Optional Form (OF) 347, Order for Supplies and Services; Standard Form (SF) 1447, Solicitation/Contract; and the SF 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items, to add to the business classification for Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) &#x201C;eligible under the WOSB Program.&#x201D;</p>
          
<br><p><b>III. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
</b></p>

          <p id="p-30" data-page="12915">Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). E.O. 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was subject to review under section 6(b) of E.O. 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804.</p>
          
<br><p><b>IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
</b></p>


          <p id="p-31" data-page="12915">DoD, GSA, and NASA have prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, <i>et seq.</i> The FRFA is summarized as follows:</p>
          
          
            <p id="p-32" data-page="12915">This rule finalizes an interim rule that revised the FAR to implement section 8(m) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(m), to provide a tool for Federal agencies to ensure equal opportunity, and thereby increases Federal procurement opportunities to Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns.</p>
            <p id="p-33" data-page="12915">The objective of the final rule is to assist Federal agencies in eliminating barriers to the participation by women-owned small business concerns in Federal contracting, thereby achieving the Federal Government&apos;s goal of awarding five percent of Federal contract dollars to women-owned small business concerns, as provided in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.</p>
            <p id="p-34" data-page="12915">There were no significant issues raised by the public in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. No public comments were filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in response to this rule.</p>
            <p id="p-35" data-page="12915">The Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database currently lists approximately 3,800 Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) owned and controlled by one or more women. While DoD, GSA, and NASA acknowledge that there may be other women-owned small business concerns in existence other than those listed in the CCR as being certified by SBA as SDBs, it is difficult to envision more than 6,000 women-owned small business concerns that could meet SBA&apos;s eligibility criteria and that are also ready, willing, and able to bid on Government contracts.</p>
            <p id="p-36" data-page="12915">In addition, not all areas of Federal procurement have been designated as underrepresented or substantially underrepresented, and opportunities in some of the qualified industries may be limited. Consequently, many otherwise-qualified EDWOSB and WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program may not find it advantageous to pursue contract opportunities under these procedures.</p>
            <p id="p-37" data-page="12915">Contracting opportunities identified by Federal agencies as candidates to be set aside for WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program (including EDWOSB concerns) will come from new contracting requirements and contracts currently performed by small and large business concerns. At this time, DoD, GSA, and NASA cannot accurately predict how the existing distribution of contracts by business type may change with this rule.</p>

            <p id="p-38" data-page="12915">DoD, GSA, and NASA determined that this rule imposes new reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The certification process described in 13 CFR Subpart C, 127.300 to 127.302, is an information collection. The certification process requires a concern seeking to benefit from Federal contracting opportunities designated for WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program or EDWOSB concerns to verify its status by providing documents to the WOSB Program Repository, submitting a certification to the WOSB Program Repository, and representing its status in an existing electronic contracting system (<i>i.e.,</i> Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)). The WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program or EDWOSB concern will have to represent in ORCA that it meets each eligibility requirement of the program. Specifically, the WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program or EDWOSB concern will be required to submit certain documents verifying eligibility at the time of certification in ORCA (and every year thereafter). These documents will be submitted to a document
:::index 79p12916

repository established by SBA. Further, the protest and eligibility examination procedures will require the submission of documents from those parties subject to a protest and eligibility examination. To reduce the burden on the WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program or EDWOSB concerns, the same documents submitted at the time of certification will be used for the protests and eligibility examinations, except that for protests and eligibility examinations, SBA will also request copies of proposals submitted in response to a solicitation set-aside for WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program or EDWOSB concerns and certain other documents and information to verify the status of an EDWOSB concern. Finally, this rule also requires the WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program or EDWOSB concerns to retain copies of the documents submitted for a period of six (6) years. DoD, GSA, and NASA believe that any additional burden imposed by this recordkeeping requirement would be minimal since the firms would maintain the information in their general course of business.</p>
            <p id="p-39" data-page="12916">This final rule minimizes the significant economic impact on small entities by allowing WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program, including EDWOSB concerns, to be certified by a Federal agency, a State government, or a national certifying entity approved by the SBA. WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program, including EDWOSB concerns, may also self-certify eligibility status to the contracting officer through submission of the required documentation in accordance with standards established by SBA. An alternative approach would have been to require EDWOSB concerns and WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program to apply for formal certification. This alternative approach was ruled out as unnecessary, not required by statute, and too costly. DoD, GSA, and NASA believe that eligibility examinations and protest procedures incorporated into this final rule will minimize the likelihood of fraud and misrepresentation of status as a WOSB concern eligible under the WOSB Program or an EDWOSB concern. DoD, GSA, and NASA have decided that allowing self-certification and the option for firms to apply for certification from SBA-approved certifiers, when combined with random eligibility examinations and a formal protest procedure is a more viable approach than formal certification and greatly reduces the burden on small entities.</p>
