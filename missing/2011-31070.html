<br><p><b>History and Description of the Cultural Item 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-8" data-page="75901">The snapping turtle rattle was purchased by Kingman Museum Inc. in January of 1975 from Iroqrafts Ltd. in Ontario, Canada. At the time of its purchase, the rattle was estimated to be 83 years old, putting the date of its creation in the late 19th century. It was made by the Gana hna &#x201C;City&#x201D; for the Deer Clan of the Onondaga Nation of New York. The head and neck of the turtle acts as the handle while the shell acts as the rattle. According to information given at the time of purchase, the rattle had been used once by the False Face Society.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="75901">Through consultation with representatives on the Haudenosaunee Standing Committee on Burial Rules and Regulations (representing the Tonawanda Seneca Nation and the Onondaga Nation), and review of museum records, the rattle has been identified as Native American and cultural affiliation has been determined between the rattle and the Onondaga Nation of New York. The aforementioned consultation also determined that the rattle is a sacred object.</p>
