    <p id="p-3" data-page="75954">The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH Act), enacted into law on May 20, 2009, consolidates three of the separate homeless assistance programs administered by HUD under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act into a single grant program, and revises the Emergency Shelter Grants program and renames it as the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program. The HEARTH Act also codifies into law the Continuum of Care planning process, a longstanding part of HUD&apos;s application process to assist homeless persons by providing greater coordination in responding to their needs.</p>
            <p id="p-4" data-page="75954">This interim rule revises the regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grants program by establishing the regulations for the Emergency Solutions Grants program, which replaces the Emergency Shelter Grants program. The change in the program&apos;s name, from Emergency Shelter Grants to Emergency Solutions Grants, reflects the change in the program&apos;s focus from addressing the needs of homeless people in emergency or transitional shelters to assisting people to quickly regain stability in permanent housing after experiencing a housing crisis and/or homelessness.</p>

<br><p><b>I. Background&#x2014;HEARTH Act 
</b></p>


          <p id="p-15" data-page="75954">On May 20, 2009, the President signed into law &#x201C;An Act to Prevent Mortgage Foreclosures and Enhance Mortgage Credit Availability,&#x201D; which became Public Law 111-22. This law implements a variety of measures directed toward keeping individuals and families from losing their homes. Division B of this law is the HEARTH Act, which consolidates and amends three separate homeless assistance programs carried out under title IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11371 <i>et seq.</i>) (McKinney-Vento Act) into a single grant program that is designed to improve administrative efficiency and enhance response coordination and effectiveness in addressing the needs of homeless persons. The HEARTH Act codifies into law and enhances the Continuum of Care planning process, the coordinated response for addressing the needs of homelessness established administratively by HUD in 1995. The single Continuum of Care program established by the HEARTH Act consolidates the following programs: the Supportive Housing program, the Shelter Plus Care program, and the Moderate Rehabilitation/Single Room Occupancy program. The Emergency Shelter Grants program is renamed the Emergency Solutions Grants program and revised to broaden existing emergency shelter and homelessness prevention activities and to add short- and medium-term rental assistance and services to rapidly re-house homeless people. In addition the new Rural Housing Stability program replaces the Rural Homelessness Grant program.</p>

          <p id="p-16" data-page="75954">HUD commenced the process to implement the HEARTH Act with a proposed rule, which was published on April 20, 2010, (<!!ln dp_fr75 75-FR-20541p75 #75-FR-20541p75>75 FR 20541</a>) and titled &#x201C;Defining Homeless.&#x201D; That proposed rule sought to clarify and elaborate upon the new McKinney-Vento Act definitions for &#x201C;homeless&#x201D; and &#x201C;homeless individual with a disability.&#x201D; In addition, the proposed rule included recordkeeping requirements related to the revised definition of &#x201C;homeless.&#x201D; The final rule for the &#x201C;homeless&#x201D; definition and the related recordkeeping requirements appears elsewhere in today&apos;s

amendments to the McKinney-Vento Act. HUD will also soon publish a proposed rule establishing regulations for Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS). The definition of &#x201C;homeless&#x201D; in this interim rule for the Emergency Solutions Grants program and the corresponding recordkeeping requirements are not the subject of further public comment. Public comment for this definition and the corresponding recordkeeping requirements were addressed in the Defining Homeless final rule published elsewhere in today&apos;s

build on lessons learned from years of practice and research, so that more resources are invested in demonstrated solutions to end homelessness, such as rapid re-housing; expand resources and services available to prevent homelessness; realign existing programs and systems to focus on shortening homelessness; direct funding to the most critical services to help people achieve long-term housing stability and avoid becoming homeless again; standardize eligibility determinations and improve the targeting of resources to help those most in need; improve data collection and performance measurement; and allow each community to tailor its program to the particular strengths and challenges within that community.</p>
          <br><p><b>General Provisions (Subpart A)</b></p>
          <p id="p-25" data-page="75956">The major changes to this subpart include new definitions required by the HEARTH Act amendments and revisions to existing definitions where needed to conform to the new program requirements or to improve administration of the program.</p>
          <br><p><b>Definitions (Section 576.2)</b></p>
          <p id="p-26" data-page="75956">
            <i>At Risk of Homelessness.</i> The interim rule clarifies the definition of &#x201C;at risk of homelessness&#x201D; under section 401(1) of the McKinney-Vento Act. The definition includes three categories under which an individual or family may qualify as &#x201C;at risk of homelessness.&#x201D; For an individual or family to qualify as &#x201C;at risk of homelessness&#x201D; under the first category of the definition, the individual or family must meet two threshold criteria and must exhibit one or more specified risk factors. The two threshold criteria, as provided in the statute, are: (1) The individual or family has income below 30 percent of median income for the geographic area; and (2) the individual or family has insufficient resources immediately available to attain housing stability. Under the interim rule, the first criterion refers specifically to annual income and to median family income for the area, as determined by HUD. The second criterion is interpreted as, &#x201C;the individual or family does not have sufficient resources or support networks, <i>e.g.,</i> family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, immediately available to prevent them from moving to an emergency shelter or another place described in paragraph (1) of the homeless definition [in &#xA7; 576.2].&#x201D; These clarifications are consistent with HUD&apos;s practice in administering its homeless assistance programs and will help ensure consistent application of these criteria.</p>
          <p id="p-27" data-page="75956">To further ensure consistency of interpretation, the interim rule also clarifies several of the risk factors that pertain to the first category of individuals and families who qualify as &#x201C;at risk of homelessness.&#x201D; As provided under the statute, the pertinent risk factors are as follows: (1) Has moved frequently because of economic reasons; (2) is living in the home of another because of economic hardship; (3) has been notified that their right to occupy their current housing or living situation will be terminated; (4) lives in a hotel or motel; (5) lives in severely overcrowded housing; (6) is exiting an institution; or (7) otherwise lives in housing that has characteristics associated with instability and an increased risk of homelessness.</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="75956">Under the interim rule, the words &#x201C;has moved frequently&#x201D; in the first risk factor are interpreted as &#x201C;2 or more times during the 60 days immediately preceding the application for homelessness prevention assistance.&#x201D; This interpretation is consistent with HUD&apos;s interpretation of similar language in the &#x201C;homeless&#x201D; definition. However, HUD is still considering whether and how to clarify &#x201C;economic reasons&#x201D; in the first risk factor and &#x201C;economic hardship&#x201D; in the second risk factor. HUD believes at times, &#x201C;economic reasons&#x201D; and &#x201C;economic hardship&#x201D; can have the same meaning, HUD specifically requests comments regarding these terms.</p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="75956">The third risk factor, &#x201C;has been notified that their right to occupy their current housing or living situation will be terminated,&#x201D; is clarified by adding that the notice has to be in writing and that the termination has to be within 21 days after the date of application for assistance.</p>
          <p id="p-30" data-page="75956">The fourth risk factor, &#x201C;lives in a hotel or motel,&#x201D; is clarified by adding &#x201C;and the cost of the hotel or motel is not paid for by federal, state, or local government programs for low-income individuals or by charitable organizations.&#x201D; This change is being made to avoid overlap with the conditions under which an individual or family living in a hotel or motel qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(ii) of the &#x201C;homeless&#x201D; definition (section 103(a)(3) of the McKinney-Vento Act).</p>
          <p id="p-31" data-page="75956">The fifth risk factor, &#x201C;lives in severely overcrowded housing,&#x201D; is interpreted as &#x201C;lives in a single-room occupancy or efficiency apartment unit in which more than two persons, on average, reside or another type of housing in which there reside more than 1.5 persons per room, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.&#x201D;</p>
          <p id="p-32" data-page="75956">The sixth risk factor, &#x201C;is exiting an institution,&#x201D; is interpreted as &#x201C;a publicly funded institution or system of care, such as a health-care facility, mental health facility, foster care or other youth facility, or correction program or institution.&#x201D; This language is derived from section 406 of the McKinney-Vento Act to include all public institutions and systems of care from which people may be discharged into homelessness.</p>
          <p id="p-33" data-page="75956">The seventh risk factor, &#x201C;otherwise lives in housing that has characteristics associated with instability and an increased risk of homelessness,&#x201D; remains as is, but requires the particular housing characteristics to be identified in the recipient&apos;s HUD-approved consolidated plan. This requirement strives to balance the need for consistent application of this risk factor with sensitivity to the differences in the conditions of each community&apos;s housing stock.</p>

          <p id="p-34" data-page="75956">The second and third categories under which individuals and families may qualify as &#x201C;at risk of homelessness&#x201D; are based on the last sentence of section 401(1) of the McKinney-Vento Act, which provides that the term &#x201C;at risk of homelessness&#x201D; includes all families with children and youth defined as homeless under other federal statutes. The term &#x201C;families with children and youth defined as homeless under other federal statutes&#x201D; is defined under section 401(7) of the McKinney-Vento Act. Section 401(7) provides that this term means &#x201C;any children or youth that are defined as `homeless&apos; under any Federal statute other than this subtitle, but are not defined as homeless under section 103, and shall also include the parent, parents, or guardian of such children or youth under subtitle B of title VII this Act (42 U.S.C. 11431 <i>et seq.</i>).&#x201D;</p>

          <p id="p-35" data-page="75956">For the sake of clarity, the definition of &#x201C;at risk of homelessness&#x201D; this interim rule uses separate categories to describe the children and youth defined as homeless under other federal statutes and to describe the children and youth defined as homeless under subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Act and their parent(s) or guardian(s). In light of comments received in response to the proposed rule concerning the definition of &#x201C;homeless&#x201D; HUD has provided specific citations to the other federal statutes that are applicable to the first of these two categories. As for the last category, the interim rule clarifies that the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the children or youth defined as homeless under subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Act must be living with those children or youth to qualify as &#x201C;at risk of homelessness&#x201D; under that category.

          <p id="p-36" data-page="75957">
            <i>Emergency shelter.</i> This interim rule revises certain definitions currently found in the existing part 576 regulations. The definition of &#x201C;emergency shelter&#x201D; has been revised to distinguish this type of shelter from transitional housing. This distinction is necessitated by the McKinney-Vento Act&apos;s explicit distinction between what activities can or cannot be funded under the Continuum of Care program and the Rural Housing Stability program (see section 423(a)(2) and section 491(b)(1)(E) of the McKinney-Vento Act). However, under the definition, any project that received funding in FY 2010 as an emergency shelter may continue to be funded under the ESG program, regardless of whether the project meets the revised definition.</p>
          <p id="p-37" data-page="75957">
            <i>Homeless.</i> The interim rule includes the definition of &#x201C;homeless&#x201D; which is made final by the Defining Homeless rule, published elsewhere in today&apos;s

related to emergency shelter, as they are limited to those necessary to provide emergency care on the street. To the extent possible, essential services related to emergency shelter and street outreach are the same as the eligible costs for supportive services under the Continuum of Care program. This consistency across these three sets of services is intended to improve understanding of the programs&apos; requirements, facilitate coordination, and maximize efficiency.</p>
          <p id="p-48" data-page="75958">The interim rule revises the eligible costs for operating emergency shelters by removing the limit on staff costs, adding the cost of supplies, and allowing the cost of a hotel or motel stay under certain conditions.</p>
          <p id="p-49" data-page="75958">The interim rule clarifies the &#x201C;maintenance of effort&#x201D; requirement in two respects. First, the references to new service and quantifiable increase in services are eliminated in favor of simply prohibiting a unit of general purpose local government from using ESG funds to replace funds the local government provided for street outreach or emergency shelter services during the immediately preceding 12-month period, unless HUD determines that the unit of general purpose local government is in a severe financial deficit. Second, the interim rule specifies how this determination would be made.</p>
          <p id="p-50" data-page="75958">
            <i>Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Components.</i> HUD has interpreted sections 415(a)(4) and (5) of the McKinney-Vento Act to authorize ESG funds to be used for short- and medium-term rental assistance and housing relocation and stabilization services for homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing of homeless individuals and families into permanent housing. Consistent with this interpretation and to serve HUD&apos;s programmatic goals, the interim rule categorizes the eligible activities under sections 415(a)(4) and (5) of the McKinney-Vento Act under two program components&#x2014;one for homelessness prevention and one for rapid re-housing assistance. This organization is intended to be function/outcome-focused and helps emphasize the integral relationship between rental assistance and housing relocation and stabilization services in both homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing assistance. This organization also provides for differentiation between the conditions for providing homelessness prevention and the conditions for providing rapid re-housing assistance. These conditions are intended to facilitate the strategic and efficient targeting of resources.</p>
          <p id="p-51" data-page="75958">
            <i>Housing Relocation and Stabilization Services.</i> The eligible costs and requirements for providing housing relocation and stabilization services are based on HUD&apos;s experience in developing and administering HPRP. For the purpose of determining compliance with the statutory limit on street outreach and emergency shelter activities, housing stability case management and legal services are distinguished from the case management and legal services in the essential services sections of street outreach and emergency shelter by when and for what purpose the case management and legal services are provided. Note that &#x201C;housing relocation and stabilization services,&#x201D; the name of which comes from section 415(a)(5) of the McKinney-Vento Act, are not to be confused with the relocation assistance and payments required under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655). Costs arising under the URA are eligible for federal financial assistance in the same manner and to the same extent as other program or project costs (see 42 U.S.C. 4631(a)), and are separately listed at &#xA7; 576.102 of this interim rule.</p>
          <p id="p-52" data-page="75958">
            <i>Short-term and Medium-term Rental Assistance.</i> Consistent with HPRP, HUD has interpreted short-term rental assistance to be up to 3 months of assistance. Unlike HPRP, HUD has interpreted medium-term rental assistance to be up to 24 months. This change is intended for consistency with the period for transitional housing in the Continuum of Care (CoC) program.</p>
          <p id="p-53" data-page="75958">The requirements for short- and medium-term rental assistance require that a program participant and a housing owner have a written lease for the provision of rental assistance. In addition, the interim rule also requires a rental assistance agreement between the recipient or subrecipient and the housing owner. Similar to HPRP, the interim rule gives Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) recipients broad discretion in determining the type, amount, and duration of rental assistance a program participant can receive for homelessness prevention or rapid re-housing assistance. But where HPRP allows only tenant-based rental assistance, the interim rule allows rental assistance to be tenant-based or project-based, as provided under section 415(a)(4) of the McKinney-Vento Act. However, the requirements for project-based rental assistance under this interim rule have been specially designed to accommodate both the impermanent nature of the rental assistance and the program goal of helping people quickly re-enter permanent housing and achieve long-term stability in that housing. For example, instead of requiring an individual or family to move from an assisted unit when the individual or family&apos;s assistance ends, the interim rule provides for the assistance to be suspended, terminated, or transferred to another unit.</p>
          <p id="p-54" data-page="75958">HUD specifically requests comments on how short- to medium-term project-based rental assistance can best be fashioned to avoid forcing each program participant to move at the end of the program participant&apos;s term of assistance and to make project-based rental assistance a feasible and useful alternative to tenant-based rental assistance.</p>
          <p id="p-55" data-page="75958">Similar to the rules of other HUD housing programs, the interim rule prohibits rental assistance from being provided for a housing unit, unless the total rent for the unit does not exceed the fair market rent established by HUD, as provided under 24 CFR 982.503, and complies with HUD&apos;s standard of rent reasonableness, as established under 24 CFR 982.507. These rent restrictions are intended to make sure that program participants can remain in their housing after their ESG assistance ends.</p>
          <p id="p-56" data-page="75958">
            <i>HMIS Component.</i> Section 416(f) of the McKinney-Vento Act requires for the first time that projects receiving funding under Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) program participate in an HMIS. The interim rule makes certain HMIS costs eligible to the extent necessary to enable this participation. HUD will soon be publishing a proposed rule on HMIS to establish in 24 CFR part 580, the regulations that will govern HMIS. In addition to establishing HMIS regulations in a new part 580 provisions, the HMIS rule will propose corresponding amendments to this interim rule regarding the use of Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds for HMIS and the incorporation of the requirements under part 580 that will apply to ESG recipients.</p>

            <i>Administrative Activities.</i> Under this interim rule, the eligible costs for administrative activities have been expanded to reflect most of the eligible administrative costs under the CDBG program. The revisions to the sharing requirement also clarify that, although not required, funds for administrative costs may be shared with private nonprofit organizations, and a reasonable amount must be shared with units of general purpose local government. This clarification is made in response to grantee and subgrantee concerns and questions raised through the recent GAO report, <i>Homelessness: Information on Administrative Costs for

The interim rule provides that Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds may be used to pay indirect costs in accordance with OMB Circulars A-87 (2 CFR part 225) and A-122 (2 CFR part 230), as applicable. Indirect costs may be allocated to each eligible activity, so long as the allocation is consistent with an indirect cost rate proposal developed in accordance with OMB Circulars A-87 (2 CFR part 225) and A-122 (2 CFR part 230), as applicable. The indirect costs charged to an activity subject to an expenditure limit must be added to the direct costs charged for that activity when determining the total costs subject to the expenditure limit.</p>

            <i>Obligation, expenditure, and payment requirements.</i> The interim rule clarifies the obligation of funds requirements and imposes new expenditure-of-funds requirements. The interim rule requires the recipient to draw down its funds from each year&apos;s allocation not less than once during each quarter of the recipient&apos;s program year. This requirement is based on HUD&apos;s experience in administering homeless assistance grants, and is intended to ensure the timely reimbursements from HUD to recipients. In addition, the recipient (and its subrecipients that are units of general purpose local government) will be required to make timely payments to each of its subrecipients within 30 days after the date of receiving the subrecipient&apos;s complete payment request. This requirement is also based on HUD&apos;s experience in administering homeless assistance grants and is intended to ensure timely payment of private nonprofit organizations, which may not be able to cover their expenses for as long a period as state and local governments. As in the Emergency Shelter Grants program, all of the recipient&apos;s grant must be expended for eligible activity costs within 24 months after the date HUD signs the grant agreement with the recipient.</p>

          <p id="p-64" data-page="75959">The interim rule makes substantial changes to the Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) reallocation provisions in order to improve administrative efficiency. For example, if the amount of unused or returned funds is not sufficient to justify the administrative burden of reallocating those funds, whether for HUD or ESG recipients, the interim rule provides for those funds to be added to the next fiscal year allocation.</p>

          <p id="p-66" data-page="75959">
            <i>Systems coordination.</i> Consistent with sections 402(f) and 413(b) of the McKinney-Vento Act, the interim rule contains a new requirement for Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) recipients to consult with Continuums of Care in allocating funds for eligible activities; developing performance standards, evaluating outcomes of (ESG)-assisted projects and developing funding, policies, and procedures for the administration and operation of the HMIS. This requirement will be discussed in further detail in regard to the revisions of the consolidated planning requirements at 24 CFR part 91 (section II.B of this preamble).</p>

          <p id="p-67" data-page="75959">The interim rule requires ESG recipients and subrecipients to coordinate and integrate, to the maximum extent practicable, ESG-funded activities with other programs targeted toward homeless people, as well as mainstream housing, health, social services, employment, education, and youth programs for which families and individuals at risk of homelessness and homeless individuals and families may be eligible. These requirements are consistent with recurring HUD appropriations language for the homeless assistance grants and with the <i>Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness</i> (FSP).<sup>

            <i>Centralized or coordinated assessment.</i> This interim rule introduces a proposed requirement for ESG recipients and subrecipients to use a centralized or coordinated system to initially assess the eligibility and needs of each individual or family who seeks homeless assistance or homelessness prevention assistance. This centralized or coordinated assessment system would be developed and implemented by the Continuum of Care in accordance with minimum requirements to be established by HUD. HUD is currently developing its minimum requirements for these systems and will present these requirements for public review and comment in the upcoming proposed rule for the Continuum of Care program. Please note that this interim rule does not require any ESG recipient or subrecipient to use a centralized or coordinated assessment system until the Continuum of Care program final rule has been published and until the Continuum of Care for the area develops and implements a system that meets the minimum requirements in that final rule.</p>

          <p id="p-70" data-page="75959">Through the administration of the Rapid Re-Housing for Families Demonstration program and the
:::index 76p75960

Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program, as well as best practices identified in communities, HUD has learned that centralized or coordinated assessment systems are important in ensuring the success of homeless assistance and homeless prevention programs in communities. In particular, such assessment systems help communities systematically assess the needs of program participants and effectively match each individual or family with the most appropriate resources available to address that individual or family&apos;s particular needs.</p>
          <p id="p-71" data-page="75960">Therefore, HUD intends to require each Continuum of Care to develop and implement a centralized or coordinated assessment system in its geographic area. Such a system must be designed locally in response to local needs and conditions. For example, rural areas will have significantly different systems than urban ones. While the common thread between typical models is the use of a common assessment tool (such as a vulnerability index), the form, detail, and use of that tool will vary from one community to the next. Some examples of centralized or coordinated assessment systems include: A central location or locations within a geographic area where individuals and families must present for homeless services; a 211 or other hotline system that screens and directly connects callers to appropriate homeless housing/service providers in the area; a &#x201C;no wrong door&#x201D; approach in which a homeless family or individual can present at any homeless service provider in the geographic area but is assessed using the same tool and methodology so that referrals are consistently completed across the Continuum of Care; a specialized team of case workers that provides assessment services to providers within the Continuum of Care; or in larger geographic areas, a regional approach in which &#x201C;hubs&#x201D; are created within smaller geographic areas.</p>
          <p id="p-72" data-page="75960">HUD recognizes that imposing a requirement for a centralized or coordinated assessment system may have certain costs and risks. Among the risks that HUD wishes specifically to address are the risks facing individuals and families fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In developing the baseline requirements for a centralized or coordinated intake system, HUD is considering whether victim service providers should be exempt from participating in a local centralized or coordinated assessment process, or whether victim service providers should have the option to participate or not. HUD is seeking comment specifically from ESG-funded victim service providers on this question. HUD also plans to require each Continuum of Care to develop a specific policy on how its particular system will address the needs of individuals and families who are fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, but who are seeking shelter or services from non-victim service providers. These policies could include reserving private areas at an assessment location for evaluations of individuals or families who are fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking; a separate &#x201C;track&#x201D; within the assessment framework that is specifically designed for domestic violence victims; or the co-location of victim service providers with centralized assessment teams.</p>
          <p id="p-73" data-page="75960">HUD invites suggestions for ensuring that the requirements it imposes regarding centralized or coordinated assessment systems will best help communities use their resources effectively and best meet the needs of all families and individuals who need assistance. Some specific questions HUD asks commenters to address are: What barriers to accessing housing/services might a centralized or coordinated intake system pose to victims of domestic violence? How can those barriers be eliminated? What specific measures should be implemented to ensure safety and confidentiality for individuals and families who are fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence situations? How should those additional standards be implemented to ensure that victims of domestic violence have immediate access to housing and services without increasing the burden on those victims? For communities that already have centralized or coordinated assessment systems in place, are victims of domestic violence and/or domestic violence service providers integrated into that system? In either scenario (they are integrated into an assessment process or they are not integrated into it), how does your community ensure the safety and confidentiality of this population, as well as access to homeless housing and services? What HUD-sponsored training would be helpful to assist communities in completing the initial assessment of victims of domestic violence in a safe and confidential manner?</p>
          <p id="p-74" data-page="75960">In addition to comments addressing the needs of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, HUD invites general comments on the use of a centralized or coordinated assessment system, particularly from those in communities that have already implemented one of these systems who can share both what has worked well and how these systems could be improved. HUD specifically seeks comment on any additional risks that a centralized or coordinated assessment system may create for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are seeking emergency shelter services due to immediate danger, regardless of whether they are seeking services through a victim service provider or non-victim service provider.</p>
          <p id="p-75" data-page="75960">
            <i>Standards for administering assistance and minimum assistance requirements.</i> As discussed later in this preamble with respect to the revisions to HUD&apos;s Consolidated Plan regulations in 24 CFR part 91, this interim rule requires a number of written standards to be established by recipients and subrecipients for administering ESG assistance, in order to balance the broad discretion given to recipients in developing street outreach, emergency shelter, rapid re-housing, and homelessness prevention programs to accommodate the unique needs, strengths, and other characteristics of their communities.</p>
          <p id="p-76" data-page="75960">The interim rule also specifies that all program participants must be assisted as needed in obtaining services and financial assistance through other homeless and public assistance programs. Furthermore, each program participant receiving homelessness prevention or rapid re-housing assistance must be required to meet regularly with a case manager (except where prohibited by Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA)), and the assistance provider must develop an individualized plan to help that program participant retain permanent housing after the ESG assistance ends. These requirements are intended to help ensure that the ESG-funded emergency, short-term or medium-term assistance will be effective in helping program participants regain long-term housing stability and avoid relapses into homelessness.</p>
          <p id="p-77" data-page="75960">
            <i>Terminating Assistance.</i> If a program participant who receives ESG assistance violates program requirements, the recipient or subrecipient may terminate the assistance in accordance with a formal process established by the recipient or subrecipient that protects the rights of the individuals affected. This applies to all forms of ESG assistance. In this interim rule, HUD enhances the minimum process
:::index 76p75961

requirements for the termination of homelessness prevention or rapid re-housing assistance, in order to reflect the process set forth in the Supportive Housing Program (SHP) regulations. These enhanced process requirements are prompted by the longer duration and higher expectations involved in homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing assistance, as compared to the duration and expectations involved in street outreach or emergency shelter activities.</p>
          <p id="p-78" data-page="75961">To terminate rental assistance or housing relocation and stabilization services to a program participant, the minimum required formal process must consist of a written notice to the program participant containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination, a review of the decision, and a prompt written notice of the final decision to the program participant. The review of the decision must give the program participant the opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision. In addition, the interim rule provides that the recipient or subrecipient may resume assistance to a family or individual whose assistance has been terminated.</p>
          <p id="p-79" data-page="75961">
            <i>Shelter and Housing Standards.</i> The revised habitability standards incorporate lead-based paint remediation and disclosure requirements. The revised standards for emergency shelters require all shelters to meet minimum habitability standards adopted from the SHP regulations and current Emergency Solutions Grant guidance. Shelters renovated with ESG funds are also required to meet state or local government safety and sanitation standards, as applicable, include energy-efficient appliances and materials. If ESG funds are used to help a program participant remain in or move into permanent housing, that housing must meet habitability standards.</p>
          <p id="p-80" data-page="75961">
            <i>Conflicts of Interest.</i> This interim rule clarifies the existing personal conflicts- of-interest provision by incorporating language from the CDBG program regulation. In addition, the interim rule adds a new provision to reduce organizational conflicts of interest, based on HUD&apos;s experience in administering HPRP.</p>
          <p id="p-81" data-page="75961">
            <i>Homeless Participation.</i> The interim rule revises the current homeless participation requirement so that if a recipient is unable to meet the participation of homeless individuals requirement in section 416(d) of the McKinney-Vento Act, the recipient need not submit and obtain HUD approval of a formal waiver request, so long as the recipient develops a plan to consult with homeless or formerly homeless individuals in considering and making policies and decisions regarding any facilities, services, or other assistance that receive ESG funding; includes the plan in its annual action plan to be submitted under 24 CFR part 91; and obtains HUD&apos;s approval of its annual action plan. This revision is intended to reduce administrative burden to both recipients and to HUD.</p>
          <p id="p-82" data-page="75961">
            <i>Other Federal Requirements.</i> In general, the revisions to the section on &#x201C;other Federal requirements&#x201D; clarify the degree to which certain requirements are applicable, remove certain requirements that are redundant or moved elsewhere in the rule for improved organizational purposes, and change certain requirements to correspond with changes in the McKinney-Vento Act or other changes made by this interim rule. Chief among these changes is the change to the environmental review requirements in accordance with the HEARTH Act&apos;s repeal of section 443 of the McKinney-Vento Act. Under this interim rule, Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) activities would be made subject to environmental review by HUD under HUD&apos;s environmental regulations in 24 CFR part 50, and HUD&apos;s environmental regulations in 24 CFR part 58 will no longer be applicable to such activities.</p>
          <p id="p-83" data-page="75961">The interim rule does not retain the provision in the current Emergency Shelter Grants program regulation specifying that for purposes of this program, the term &#x201C;dwelling units&#x201D; under 24 CFR part 8 includes &#x201C;sleeping accommodations.&#x201D; The language is being removed because it did not provide grantees with direction on how to apply this provision. Nevertheless, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD&apos;s implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8 apply to the Emergency Solutions Grants program, including accessibility requirements under Subpart C&#x2014;Program Accessibility. A recipient shall operate each existing program or activity receiving federal financial assistance so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Grantees are also required to provide reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities in order to enable program participants with a disability to have an equal opportunity to participate in the program or activity.</p>
          <p id="p-84" data-page="75961">Grantees that undertake alterations to shelters may be subject to additional accessibility requirements in accordance with 24 CFR part 8. In certain instances, recipients undertaking alterations may be required to ensure that 5 percent of the total sleeping areas, such as 5 percent (or at least one) of the sleeping rooms where a number of sleeping rooms are provided, and 5 percent (or at least one) of the total number of sleeping areas, such as beds, where a number of beds are provided in a room, are accessible for persons with mobility impairments and that an additional 2 percent of the total individual sleeping areas are accessible for persons with visual impairments. The Americans with Disabilities Act may also apply and require a greater level of accessibility in certain shelters.</p>
          <p id="p-85" data-page="75961">
            <i>Relocation and Acquisition.</i> The interim rule updates the relocation and acquisition requirements and makes them more consistent with the requirements in other HUD programs. Section 576.102 specifies that the cost of providing relocation assistance and payments arising out of the Uniform Act (URA) is an eligible activity, as per section 211 of the URA (42 U.S.C. 4631(a)). Temporary relocation and other alternatives to minimize displacement in other HUD programs that provide permanent housing are inapplicable due to the nature of the ESG program. Emergency shelters assisted under the ESG program provide temporary shelter for the homeless. Existing tenants would not fall within the program definition of &#x201C;homeless.&#x201D; Section 576.408(b) provides that temporary relocation is not an available alternative to permanently displacing a tenant who moves as a direct result of acquisition, demolition, or rehabilitation for a project assisted with ESG funds. Additionally, &#xA7; 576.408(b) provides that an agency cannot avoid treating such tenant as a displaced person by offering the tenant a unit in the same building/complex upon project completion. Finally, &#xA7; 576.408(d) of the interim rule clearly states that the URA applies to an acquisition undertaken in connection with an ESG-assisted project irrespective of the source of funding for the acquisition.</p>
          <br><p><b>Grant Administration (Subpart F)</b></p>

          <p id="p-86" data-page="75961">The changes to this subpart substantially revise the Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) recordkeeping and reporting requirements and the enforcement provisions. The changes to the recordkeeping requirements include the addition of specific documentation requirements to demonstrate compliance with ESG regulations, as well as new requirements regarding record retention periods, confidentiality, and rights of access to
:::index 76p75962

records. The reporting requirements and the enforcement provisions are each expanded and further clarified.</p>
          <p id="p-87" data-page="75962">
            <i>Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</i> Grant recipients under the ESG program have always been required to show compliance with the program&apos;s regulations through appropriate records. However, the existing regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grants program are not specific about the records to be maintained. The interim rule elaborates upon the recordkeeping requirements to provide sufficient notice and clarify the documentation that HUD requires for assessing compliance with the new requirements of the program. The recordkeeping requirements for documenting homeless status were published in the proposed rule for the homeless definition.<sup>
        [5]
      </sup>
            Recordkeeping requirements with similar levels of specificity will apply to documentation of &#x201C;at risk of homelessness&#x201D; and &#x201C;annual income.&#x201D; Further requirements are modeled after the recordkeeping requirements for the HOME Investment Partnerships program (24 CFR 92.508) and other HUD regulations.</p>
          
          <p id="p-89" data-page="75962">Included along with these changes are new or expanded requirements regarding confidentiality, rights of access to records, record retention periods, and reporting requirements. Most significantly, to protect the safety and privacy of all program participants, the interim rule broadens program&apos;s confidentiality requirements. The McKinney-Vento Act only requires procedures to ensure the confidentiality of records pertaining to any individual provided family violence prevention or treatment services under the ESG program. The interim rule requires written procedures to ensure the security and confidentiality of all records containing personally identifying information of any individual or family who applies for and/or receives Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) assistance.</p>
          <p id="p-90" data-page="75962">
            <i>Enforcement.</i> The interim rule revises the sanctions section under the existing regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grants program, including the heading of the section on sanctions, to strengthen the enforcement procedures and the array of remedial actions and sanctions for recipients and subrecipients of Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds. These revisions draw from the requirements at 24 CFR 85.43 and other HUD program regulations.</p>
          <br><p><b>B. Consolidated Submissions for Community Planning and Development Programs (24 CFR Part 91)</b></p>
          <p id="p-91" data-page="75962">In addition to revising regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grants program at 24 CFR part 576 to establish the regulations for Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), this interim rule revises selected sections of the consolidated planning regulations at 24 CFR part 91, in order to reflect both the HEARTH Act amendments to the McKinney-Vento Act and significant developments in HUD&apos;s homelessness policies and program administration over the last 15 years. In developing and implementing the Continuum of Care concept through the annual notices of funding availability (NOFAs) for its competitive programs, HUD sought to establish and standardize complementary planning requirements between the homeless components of the Consolidated Plan and the annual submission of the Continuum of Care Plan. The structure of the annual Continuum of Care Plan (CoC) plan and the plan&apos;s sections on community participation, needs assessment, inventory of housing and services, strategies, annual application, and performance were developed to harmonize with the Consolidated Plan&apos;s homelessness components. Many communities closely aligned the Consolidated Plan and the Continuum of Care Plan (CoC) Plan covering their jurisdiction.</p>
          <p id="p-92" data-page="75962">The HEARTH Act amendments to the McKinney-Vento Act contain provisions requiring coordination, collaboration, and consultation between Continuums of Care and ESG state and local government recipients. The McKinney-Vento Act requires &#x201C;collaborative applicants&#x201D; under the Continuum of Care program to participate in the Consolidated Plan for the geographic areas they serve and analyze patterns of use and evaluate outcomes for ESG projects in those areas. ESG recipients in turn must consult with these collaborative applicants on the allocation of ESG funds and participate in HMIS, which the collaborative applicants are required to establish.</p>
          <p id="p-93" data-page="75962">In describing these and related requirements for cross-program coordination, this interim rule uses the term &#x201C;Continuum of Care&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;collaborative applicant.&#x201D; The interim rule defines &#x201C;Continuum of Care&#x201D; as the group composed of representatives of relevant organizations, which generally includes nonprofit homeless providers; victim service providers; faith-based organizations; governments; businesses; advocates; public housing agencies; school districts; social service providers; mental health agencies; hospitals; universities; affordable housing developers; law enforcement; organizations that serve homeless and formerly homeless veterans, and homeless and formerly homeless persons that are organized to plan for and provide, as necessary, a system of outreach, engagement, and assessment; emergency shelter; rapid re-housing; transitional housing; permanent housing; and prevention strategies to address the various needs of homeless persons and persons at risk of homelessness for a specific geographic area.</p>
          <p id="p-94" data-page="75962">The use of &#x201C;Continuum of Care&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;collaborative applicant&#x201D; is intended to maintain consistency with the terminology HUD has established and grantees have become familiar with in the Continuum of Care planning process for the Supportive Housing program, the Shelter Plus Care program, and the Moderate Rehabilitation/Single Room Occupancy program. The term &#x201C;collaborative applicant,&#x201D; as used in the McKinney-Vento Act, covers two distinct entities under the existing Continuum of Care planning process: One entity whose function is planning and facilitating collaboration and another entity whose function is applying for and managing the homeless assistance grant. Because HUD has always called the planning entity the Continuum of Care, HUD is continuing that practice in this interim rule.</p>

          <p id="p-95" data-page="75962">The interim rule strengthens and standardizes the homelessness elements affecting all jurisdictions required to submit a Consolidated Plan. The changes to the Consolidated Plan sections on homelessness have been guided by the larger purposes of the HEARTH Act and the principles and priorities put forth in the <i>Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness (FSP).</i> The changes to the Consolidated Plan will foster closer coordination between not only Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) and Continuum of Care (CoC) programs, but other mainstream housing and services programs that can provide greater resources to homeless persons and people at imminent risk of homelessness.</p>
          <p id="p-96" data-page="75962">
            <i>Definitions.</i> The Consolidated Plan regulations are modified to add and revise this section to conform to definitions used in this interim rule for 24 CFR part 576 and the proposed rule that will soon be published for the Continuum of Care program. A definition of rapid re-housing assistance is added to bring coverage of general homeless assistance models in 24 CFR part 91 up-to-date. Other definitions are
:::index 76p75963

eliminated because they will no longer be used in part 91 after the changes in the regulations to the McKinney-Vento Act programs.</p>
          <p id="p-97" data-page="75963">HUD specifically invites comments regarding the definition of chronically homeless. The McKinney-Vento Act defines &#x201C;chronically homeless&#x201D; as an individual or family who: (i) Is homeless and lives or resides in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter; (ii) has been homeless and living or residing in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter continuously for at least 1 year or on at least 4 separate occasions in the last 3 years; and (iii) has an adult head of household (or a minor head of household if no adult is present in the household) with a diagnosable substance use disorder, serious mental illness, developmental disability (as defined in section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15002)), post traumatic stress disorder, cognitive impairments resulting from a brain injury, or chronic physical illness or disability, including the co-occurrence of 2 or more of those conditions. Additionally, the statutory definition includes as chronically homeless a person who currently lives or resides in an institutional care facility, including a jail, substance abuse or mental health treatment facility, hospital or other similar facility, and has resided there for fewer than 90 days if such person met the other criteria for homeless prior to entering that facility. (See 42 U.S.C. 11360(2))</p>
          <p id="p-98" data-page="75963">The regulatory definition of &#x201C;chronically homeless&#x201D; does not elaborate significantly on the statutory definition. However, HUD has determined that when an individual or family has not been continuously homeless for at least one year but has been homeless on at least four separate occasions in the last 3 years, each separate occasion must be at least 15 days in duration to ensure consistency for counting and eligibility purposes. HUD has determined that the 15-day minimum is an appropriate measure to distinguish the chronically homeless from the homeless population in general, so as to recognize chronically homeless people who have spent a significant amount of time as homeless.</p>
          <p id="p-99" data-page="75963">The regulatory definition also clarifies that a family will qualify as chronically homeless if the head of household has met all of the requirements in paragraphs (i) through (iii) of the statutory definition, given that a family&apos;s composition may fluctuate during the course of the head of household&apos;s homeless experience.</p>
          <p id="p-100" data-page="75963">
            <i>Consultation: Local Governments/States.</i> The interim rule revises the consultation requirements in 24 CFR part 91 to implement the McKinney-Vento Act&apos;s new requirement that ESG recipients consult with Continuums of Care when allocating their ESG funds to carry out eligible activities. In response to the concerns of prospective grantees under the Continuum of Care program, the interim rule includes several requirements to make it easier for Continuums of Care to meet their requirements under the McKinney-Vento Act, including participating in the Consolidated Plan for their jurisdiction and designing a collaborative process for evaluating the outcomes of ESG projects. Similar changes to facilitate the participation of Continuums of Care (CoCs) in the Consolidated Planning process are also made to the sections on citizen participation at 24 CFR 91.105 and 91.115.</p>
          <p id="p-101" data-page="75963">The consultation sections were also revised to conform to the FSP&apos;s emphasis not only on chronically homeless people, but on families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth, and the FSP&apos;s emphasis on strengthening collaboration with programs and entities beyond the programs targeted to homeless people. The consultation sections refer specifically to &#x201C;publicly funded institutions and systems of care that may discharge people into homelessness (such as health-care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions).&#x201D; This is done to be consistent with the emphasis on discharge planning in section 406 of the McKinney-Vento Act. For this same reason, HUD also refers to these publicly funded institutions and systems of care in each section of the interim rule that specifically addresses the prevention of homelessness.</p>
          <p id="p-102" data-page="75963">
            <i>Housing Needs Assessment; Local Governments/States.</i> The interim rule adds a new category of persons for whom states and local jurisdictions are required to assess housing assistance needs: Formerly homeless families and individuals who are receiving rapid re-housing assistance and are nearing the termination of that assistance. The addition of this category is intended to help focus communities on helping these families stay housed after their rapid re-housing assistance ends.</p>
          <p id="p-103" data-page="75963">
            <i>Homeless Needs Assessment; Local Government/States.</i> The changes under the interim rule increase HUD&apos;s flexibility in establishing and modifying standards for collecting data on homeless populations and subpopulations and performance measures. The changes also provide additional definition to the description of the characteristics and needs of persons who are currently housed but threatened with homelessness. These changes permit HUD to more closely harmonize data included in each jurisdiction&apos;s Consolidated Plan with data that the Continuum(s) of Care for that jurisdiction will be required to collect and submit under the Continuum of Care program. The collection of consistent homeless needs data in these two planning processes will permit local and national assessment of progress in meeting the goals set forth in the FSP.</p>
          <p id="p-104" data-page="75963">
            <i>Housing Market Analysis; Facilities, Housing, and Services for Homeless Persons; Local Governments/States.</i> The interim rule allows HUD to establish and modify descriptions of the facilities, housing, and services for homeless persons to increase consistency between the Consolidated Plan and the Continuum of Care Plan. The interim rule adds mainstream services to the inventory of services meeting the needs of homeless persons, consistent with the overall emphasis on using and collaborating with mainstream assistance programs to prevent and end homelessness. Similar to changes made to other sections, the special focus accorded to chronically homeless people is broadened to include families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth, in order to reflect the priorities in the FSP.</p>
          <p id="p-105" data-page="75963">
            <i>Strategic Plan; Homelessness Strategies; Local Government/States.</i> The interim rule refocuses the general homelessness-related strategies on the ultimate goals of reducing and ending homelessness and aligns them with Continuum of Care planning strategies and performance measures, such as shortening the period of time that persons experience homelessness and helping persons who were recently homeless avoid becoming homeless again. The changes under the interim rule also emphasize the priorities of the FSP. The strategic framework set out in this section is carried through in conforming changes to the Action Plan and performance reporting sections of the Consolidated Plan.</p>
          <p id="p-106" data-page="75963">
            <i>Action Plan; Local Government/States.</i> The changes to the Action Plan sections for local governments and States require the ESG recipient to consult with applicable Continuums of Care when allocating funds in the area(s) served by the Continuum(s) of Care and the ESG recipient and when

developing the performance standards for the assisted activities. These changes reflect the McKinney-Vento Act requirements that ESG recipients consult with Continuums of Care on their allocation of ESG funds and that Continuums of Care in turn analyze patterns of use of ESG funds and help evaluate outcomes for ESG-funded projects. These changes are also consistent with the statutory scheme of the HEARTH Act, which generally requires increased collaboration between Continuums of Care and ESG recipients.</p>
          <p id="p-107" data-page="75964">The changes under the interim rule for the ESG portion of the action plan require each local government seeking an ESG grant to specify the standards under which homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing assistance will be administered and describe the centralized or coordinated assessments system(s) that will be used. By helping to ensure that the program is administered fairly and methodically, these requirements provide balance to the broad discretion that ESG recipients are given in the design of their ESG programs. Including these standards in the action plan allows the program design to be strengthened as the plan is developed and refined through the consultation and citizen participation stages in the planning process. The requirements for states differ slightly from those that apply to local governments, in order to accommodate for the restrictions on states&apos; use of ESG funds and the variety of areas and Continuums of Care their programs encompass. Under the state programs, the written standards for providing ESG assistance may vary by subrecipient, Continuum of Care, or the geographic area over which services are coordinated.</p>

<br><p><b>III. Justification for Interim Rulemaking 
</b></p>

          <p id="p-109" data-page="75964">In accordance with its regulations on rulemaking at 24 CFR part 10, HUD generally publishes its rules for advance public comment. Notice and public procedures may be omitted, however, if HUD determines that, in a particular case or class of cases, notice and public procedure are &#x201C;impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.&#x201D; (See 24 CFR 10.1.)</p>
          <p id="p-110" data-page="75964">In this case, HUD has determined that it would be contrary to the public interest to delay promulgation of the regulations for the Emergency Solutions Grants program because Congress has provided funding for this new program in the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Pub. L. 112-10, approved April 15, 2011) (FY 2011 Appropriations Act). The FY 2011 Appropriations Act appropriates, in section 2241 of the statute, $1,905,000,000 for homeless assistance grants, of which at least $225,000,000 shall be for the Emergency Solutions Grant program. While many federal programs, including HUD programs, received a reduction in funding in the FY 2011 Appropriations Act, Congress increased funding for HUD&apos;s homeless assistance grants, and for the first time, authorized funding for a program, (the Emergency Solutions Grants program). HUD interprets this increase in funding as recognition by Congress of the significant needs that remain to help America&apos;s homeless population and the expectation of Congress that HUD will move expediently to expend this funding to assist and serve the homeless through its programs. HUD interprets the substantial funding, a minimum of $225,000,000, for the Emergency Solutions Grant program, as recognition by Congress that this program, which is an expansion of the predecessor Emergency Shelter Grants program, and includes features that were part of the Recovery Act&apos;s HPRP, is one that can have an immediate impact in helping the homeless.</p>
          <p id="p-111" data-page="75964">Given what HUD sees as a congressional charge to move expediently, HUD is issuing this rule providing for regulations for the Emergency Solutions Grants program as an interim rule. Interim regulations in place will allow HUD to move forward in making FY 2011 funds available to grantees. As has been discussed in this preamble, the foundation for the regulations for the Emergency Solutions Grants program are those of its predecessor program, the Emergency Shelters Grant program, regulations with which HUD grantees are well familiar. HUD grantees are also familiar with the requirements of the HPRP and, as the preamble has highlighted, this interim rule adopts many of the features and requirements of HPRP.</p>
          <p id="p-112" data-page="75964">Although for the reasons stated above, HUD is issuing this rule to take immediate effect, HUD welcomes all comments on this interim rule and all comments will be taken into consideration in the development of the final rule.</p>
          
<br><p><b>IV. Findings and Certifications 
</b></p>

          <br><p><b>Regulatory Planning and Review</b></p>
          <p id="p-113" data-page="75964">OMB reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12866, <i>Regulatory Planning and Review.</i> This rule was determined to be a &#x201C;significant regulatory action,&#x201D; as defined in section 3(f) of the order (although not an economically significant regulatory action under the order). As discussed earlier in this preamble, this interim rule establishes the regulations for the Emergency Solutions Grants program, which is the successor program to the Emergency Shelter Grants program. In establishing the regulations for the Emergency Solutions Grants program, the interim rule uses as its base the regulations for the Emergency Shelter Grants program and makes such changes as necessary to reflect the changes and focus of the Emergency Solutions Grants program. While emergency shelter remains an important component of the Emergency Solutions Grants program, the new Emergency Solutions Grants program places a greater focus on homelessness prevention for persons at risk of homelessness and rapid re-housing assistance for homeless persons. Accordingly, the rule does not alter the fundamental goal of the program, which is to assist those who are homeless and in danger of becoming homeless. Therefore, the administrative changes made by this rule do not result in an economic effect equal to $100 million, which would be approximately half of the program&apos;s funding ($225 million). HUD believes that the administrative changes made by the interim rule would also have no discernible impact upon the economy.</p>
          <p id="p-114" data-page="75964">The slight shift in emphasis from emergency shelter in the Emergency Shelter Grants program to homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing assistance in the Emergency Solutions Grants program does not represent a significant regulatory change. Rapid rehousing is already familiar to HUD&apos;s homeless grantee providers from funding received under the HPRP, a temporary program funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and their experience with this program which continues to today. Because HPRP activities will continue through September 30, 2012, the interim rule is directed to ensuring continuity between HPRP and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) program.</p>

          <br><p><b>Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</b></p>
          <p id="p-117" data-page="75965">The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) (UMRA) establishes requirements for federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector. This interim rule does not impose a federal mandate on any state, local, or tribal government, or on the private sector, within the meaning of UMRA.</p>
          <br><p><b>Regulatory Flexibility Act</b></p>
          <p id="p-118" data-page="75965">The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <i>et seq.</i>) generally requires an agency to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements, unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule solely addresses the allocation and use of grant funds under the new McKinney-Vento Act homeless assistance programs as consolidated and amended by the HEARTH Act. As discussed in the preamble, the majority of the regulatory provisions in this rule track the regulatory provisions of the existing Emergency Shelter Grants program, with which prospective recipients of Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) are familiar. Accordingly, the transition from the Emergency Shelter Grants program to the Emergency Solutions Grant program, in regard to funding and program requirements, should raise minimal issues because applicants and grantees are well-familiar with these requirements and, through the years, in soliciting information on the burden of the Emergency Solutions Grant requirements, grantees have not advised that such requirements are burdensome. Therefore, HUD has determined that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</p>
          <p id="p-119" data-page="75965">Notwithstanding that determination, HUD specifically invites comments regarding any less burdensome alternatives to this rule that will meet HUD&apos;s objectives as described in this preamble.</p>

This final rule does not have federalism implications and does not impose substantial direct compliance costs on state and local governments nor preempt state law within the meaning of the executive order.</p>

The rent paid before a program participant moves into the unit must not exceed the rent to be charged under the program participant&apos;s lease and must be included when determining that program participant&apos;s total rental assistance.</p>

                  <p id="p-512" data-page="75981">(3) The recipient or subrecipient may make monthly rental assistance payments only for each whole or partial month an assisted unit is leased to a program participant. When a program participant moves out of an assisted unit, the recipient or subrecipient may pay the next month&apos;s rent, <i>i.e.,</i> the first month&apos;s rent for a new program participant, as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</p>
                  <p id="p-513" data-page="75981">(4) The program participant&apos;s lease must not condition the term of occupancy to the provision of rental assistance payments. If the program participant is determined ineligible or reaches the maximum number of months over which rental assistance can be provided, the recipient or subrecipient must suspend or terminate the rental assistance payments for the unit. If the payments are suspended, the individual or family may remain in the assisted unit as permitted under the lease, and the recipient or subrecipient may resume payments if the individual or family again becomes eligible and needs further rental assistance. If the payments are terminated, the rental assistance may be transferred to another available unit in the same building, provided that the other unit meets all ESG requirements.</p>
                  <p id="p-514" data-page="75981">(5) The rental assistance agreement must have an initial term of one year. When a new program participant moves into an assisted unit, the term of the rental assistance agreement may be extended to cover the initial term of the program participant&apos;s lease. If the program participant&apos;s lease is renewed, the rental assistance agreement may be renewed or extended, as needed, up to the maximum number of months for which the program participant remains eligible. However, under no circumstances may the recipient or subrecipient commit ESG funds to be expended beyond the expenditure deadline in &#xA7; 576.203 or commit funds for a future ESG grant before the grant is awarded.</p>

No subrecipient may, with respect to individuals or families occupying housing owned by the subrecipient, or any parent or subsidiary of the subrecipient, carry out the initial evaluation required under &#xA7; 576.401 or administer homelessness prevention assistance under &#xA7; 576.103.</p>

For all other transactions and activities, the following restrictions apply:</p>
                  <p id="p-727" data-page="75987">(1) <i>Conflicts prohibited.</i> No person described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted under the ESG program, or who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to activities assisted under the program, may obtain a financial interest or benefit from an assisted activity; have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect to an assisted activity; or have a financial interest in the proceeds derived from an assisted activity, either for him or herself or for those with whom he or she has family or business ties, during his or her tenure or during the one-year period following his or her tenure.</p>
                  <p id="p-728" data-page="75987">(2) <i>Persons covered.</i> The conflict-of- interest provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to any person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the recipient or its subrecipients.</p>

                  <p id="p-730" data-page="75987">(i) <i>Threshold requirements.</i> HUD will consider an exception only after the recipient has provided the following documentation:</p>

                  <p id="p-734" data-page="75988">(A) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project that would otherwise not be available;</p>

                  <p id="p-742" data-page="75988">(b) If the recipient is unable to meet requirement under paragraph (a), it must instead develop and implement a plan to consult with homeless or formerly homeless individuals in considering and making policies and decisions regarding any facilities, services, or other assistance that receive funding under Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG). The plan must be included in the annual action plan required under 24 CFR 91.220.</p>
                  <p id="p-743" data-page="75988">(c) To the maximum extent practicable, the recipient or subrecipient must involve homeless individuals and families in constructing, renovating, maintaining, and operating facilities assisted under ESG, in providing services assisted under ESG, and in providing services for occupants of facilities assisted under ESG.

<br><p><b>&#xA7; 576.406 Faith-based activities.</b></p>

                  
                  <p id="p-744" data-page="75988">(a) Organizations that are religious or faith-based are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to receive ESG funds. Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government receiving funds under ESG shall discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization&apos;s religious character or affiliation.</p>
                  <p id="p-745" data-page="75988">(b) Organizations that are directly funded under the ESG program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization as part of the programs or services funded under ESG. If an organization conducts these activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services funded under ESG, and participation must be voluntary for program participants.</p>
                  <p id="p-746" data-page="75988">(c) Any religious organization that receives ESG funds retains its independence from Federal, State, and local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that the religious organization does not use direct ESG funds to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to provide ESG-funded services, without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, an ESG-funded religious organization retains its authority over its internal governance, and the organization may retain religious terms in its organization&apos;s name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization&apos;s mission statements and other governing documents.</p>
                  <p id="p-747" data-page="75988">(d) An organization that receives ESG funds shall not, in providing ESG assistance, discriminate against a program participant or prospective program participant on the basis of religion or religious belief.</p>

                  <p id="p-748" data-page="75988">(e) ESG funds may not be used for the rehabilitation of structures to the extent that those structures are used for inherently religious activities. Solutions ESG funds may be used for the rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those structures are used for conducting eligible activities under the ESG program. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently religious activities, ESG funds may not exceed the cost of those portions of the rehabilitation that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to ESG funds. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that an ESG-funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of worship, however, are ineligible for funded improvements under the program. Disposition of real property after the term of the grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing real property disposition (<i>see</i> 24 CFR parts 84 and 85).</p>
                  <p id="p-749" data-page="75988">(f) If the recipient or a subrecipient that is a local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the recipient or subrecipient has the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them.

A displaced person must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 <i>et seq.</i>). Whenever possible, minority persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to comparable and suitable decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. This policy, however, does not require providing a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable a person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling. (See 49 CFR 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(D).) As required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) and 49 CFR part 24, replacement dwellings must also contain the accessibility features needed by displaced persons with disabilities.</p>
