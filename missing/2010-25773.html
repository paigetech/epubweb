<br><p><b>Overview of This Information Collection 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-9" data-page="62857">(1) <i>Type of Information Collection:</i> Extension with Change of a Previously Approved Collection.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="62857">(2) <i>Title of the Form/Collection:</i> SENTRY Synthetic Drug Early Warning and Response System.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="62857">(3) <i>Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the Department sponsoring the collection: Form Number:</i> NDIC Form # N/A.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="62857">(4) The 2004 National Synthetic Drugs Action Plan designated the NDIC as the lead agency for developing an early warning and response system. This instrument is critical for NDIC to detect emerging drug abuse and production trends and thereafter notify law enforcement demand authorities and prepare associated reports.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="62857">From February 2009 until September 2010, the SENTRY Synthetic Drug Early Warning and Response System was available only to specifically targeted groups including chemists; education providers (teachers, administrators, school resource officers, or school nurses); law enforcement personnel; treatment providers (physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians, medical examiners); and other specific groups such as drug intelligence analysts.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="62857">The NDIC has determined that some SENTRY information may be of interest to members of the general public. As of June 2010, all SENTRY DrugAlert Watches, Drug Alert Warnings, and News and Bulletins have been made accessible to this group via the NDIC public facing Web site. The NDIC will make a SENTRY Geographic Information System map accessible to the public that includes color-coded substance categories, submission/event details, and a general locality of each submission/event.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="62857">(5) <i>An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of time estimated for an average respondent to respond:</i> It is estimated that approximately annually 300 respondents will tender a submission/event requiring approximately 15 minutes. Use of the system is expected to increase significantly.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="62857">(6) <i>An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated with the collection:</i> There is an estimated 75 total annual burden hours associated with this collection.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="62857">If you have comments especially on the estimated public burden or associated response time, suggestions, or need a copy of the proposed information collection instrument with instructions or additional information, please contact Kevin M. Walker, General Counsel, National Drug Intelligence Center, Fifth Floor, 319 Washington Street, Johnstown, PA 15901.</p>
