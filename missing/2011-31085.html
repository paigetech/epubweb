</b></p>

        <p id="p-13" data-page="75800">Pursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the collections of information in this rule have been approved by OMB under control number 0563-0053 through March 31, 2012. However, FCIC is creating a new package for the information collection requirements necessary for administering 7 CFR, part 400, subpart U.</p>

          <i>Abstract:</i> The following mandates require FCIC to identify persons who are ineligible to participate in the Federal crop insurance program administered under the Federal Crop Insurance Act.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="75800">(1) Section 1764 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (99);</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="75800">(2) 21 U.S.C., Chapter 13;</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="75800">(3) Section 14211 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-246);</p>
        <p id="p-23" data-page="75800">(4) Executive Order 12549; and</p>
        <p id="p-24" data-page="75800">(5) 7 U.S.C. 1515.</p>
        <p id="p-25" data-page="75800">The FCIC and Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs) use the information collected to determine whether persons seeking to obtain Federal crop insurance coverage are ineligible for such coverage according to the aforementioned mandates. The purpose of collecting the information is to ensure persons that are ineligible for benefits under the Federal crop insurance program are accurately identified as such and do not obtain benefits to which they are not eligible.</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="75800">FCIC and RMA do not obtain information used to identify a person as ineligible for benefits under the Federal crop insurance program directly from the ineligible person. AIPs notify RMA of persons with a delinquent debt electronically through a secure automated system. RMA (1) Sends written notification to the person informing them they are ineligible for benefits under the Federal crop insurance program; and (2) places that person on the RMA Ineligible Tracking System until the person regains eligibility for such benefits.</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="75800">RMAs Office of General Counsel notifies RMA in writing of persons convicted of controlled substance violations. RMA (1) Sends written notification to the person informing them they are ineligible for benefits under the Federal crop insurance program; and (2) places that person on RMAs Ineligible Tracking System until the person regains eligibility for such benefits.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="75800">Persons debarred, suspended or disqualified by RMA are (1) Notified, in writing, they are ineligible for benefits under the Federal crop insurance program; and (2) placed on RMAs Ineligible Tracking System until the person regains eligibility for such benefits.</p>
        <p id="p-29" data-page="75800">Information identifying persons who are ineligible for benefits under the Federal crop insurance program is made available to all AIPs through RMAs Ineligible Tracking System. The Ineligible Tracking System is an electronic system, maintained by RMA, which identifies persons who are ineligible to participate in the Federal crop insurance program. The information must be made available to all AIPs to ensure ineligible persons cannot circumvent the mandates by switching from one AIP to another.</p>
        <p id="p-30" data-page="75800">In addition, information identifying persons who are debarred, suspended or disqualified by RMA is provided to the General Services Administration to be included in the Excluded Parties List System, an electronic system maintained by the General Services Administration that provides current information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered transactions.</p>
        <p id="p-31" data-page="75800">
          <i>Estimate of burden:</i> Reporting burden for the collection and transmission of information by AIPs is estimated to average 15 minutes per response.</p>
        <p id="p-32" data-page="75800">
          <i>Respondents:</i> Approved Insurance Providers.</p>
        <p id="p-33" data-page="75800">

        <p id="p-37" data-page="75800">We are requesting comments on all aspects of this information collection to help us to:</p>
        <p id="p-38" data-page="75800">(1) Evaluate whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agencies, including whether the information will have practical utility;</p>
        <p id="p-39" data-page="75800">(2) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency&apos;s estimate of burden including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</p>

<br><p><b>E-Government Act Compliance 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-43" data-page="75800">FCIC is committed to complying with the E-Government Act of 2002, to promote the use of the Internet and other information technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen access to Government information and services, and for other purposes.</p>
        
<br><p><b>Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-44" data-page="75800">Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) establishes requirements for Federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. This rule contains no Federal mandates (under the regulatory provisions of title II of the UMRA) for State, local, and tribal governments or the private sector. Therefore, this rule is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 and 205 of UMRA.</p>
        
<br><p><b>
Executive Order 13132 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-45" data-page="75800">It has been determined under section 1(a) of Executive Order 13132,
:::index 79p75801

Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient implications to warrant consultation with the States. The provisions contained in this rule will not have a substantial direct effect on States, or on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</p>
        
<br><p><b>
Executive Order 13175 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-46" data-page="75801">This rule has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments. The review reveals that this regulation will not have substantial and direct effects on Tribal governments and will not have significant Tribal implications.</p>
        
<br><p><b>Regulatory Flexibility Act 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-47" data-page="75801">FCIC certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Program requirements for the Federal crop insurance program are the same for all producers regardless of the size of their farming operation. However, FCIC does waive certain administrative fees for limited resource farmers to help ensure that small entities are given the same opportunities as large entities to obtain crop insurance. This regulation provides the rules regarding ineligibility for crop insurance under the Act based on actions or inactions of the producer, such as violations of the Controlled Substance Act, debarment from Federal Government programs, and failure to pay premiums and administrative fees when due. As such, all producers are treated equally under this regulation. A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been prepared since this regulation does not have an unduly burdening impact on small entities, and therefore, this regulation is exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605).</p>
        
<br><p><b>Federal Assistance Program 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-48" data-page="75801">This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450.</p>

</b></p>

        <p id="p-49" data-page="75801">This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which require intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983.</p>
        
<br><p><b>
Executive Order 12988 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-50" data-page="75801">This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12988 on civil justice reform. The provisions of this rule will not have a retroactive effect. The provisions of this rule will preempt State and local laws to the extent such State and local laws are inconsistent herewith.</p>
        
<br><p><b>Environmental Evaluation 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-51" data-page="75801">This action is not expected to have a significant economic impact on the quality of the human environment, health, or safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.</p>
        
<br><p><b>Background 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-52" data-page="75801">FCIC proposes to revise 7 CFR part 400 by revising subpart U&#x2014;Ineligibility for Programs Under the Federal Crop Insurance Act to eliminate redundancies, improve clarity, remove or update obsolete references, and simplify the regulations regarding ineligibility for Federal crop insurance. The rule will also reflect the provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The Controlled Substance Act provides that persons convicted of possession or trafficking of controlled substances are ineligible for certain Federal benefits, including crop insurance. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 provides that persons who are not a United States citizen, United States non-citizen national, or a qualified alien are ineligible for certain Federal benefits, including crop insurance.</p>
        <p id="p-53" data-page="75801">The proposed rule also incorporates the provisions formally contained in 7 CFR part 400, subpart F into subpart U for efficiency and ease of use. Accordingly, subpart F will be removed and reserved.</p>
        <p id="p-54" data-page="75801">Last, 7 CFR part 400, subpart C was promulgated in 1992 to allow certain crop insurance policies to be cancelled when producers applied for crop insurance believing they were required to obtain such crop insurance in order to participate in certain Commodity Credit Corporation disaster payment programs, but subsequently determined that such crop insurance was not a prerequisite. Amendments to the Federal Crop Insurance Act and the authorization and implementation of the Noninsured Crop Assistance Program have made the provisions of subpart C obsolete. Accordingly, this rule will remove and reserve subpart C. The provisions will be effective for the 2013 and succeeding crop years.</p>
