<br><p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-5" data-page="62764">On May 3, 2010, the Department published the notice of initiation of the first sunset reviews of the antidumping duty orders on chlorinated isos from Spain and the PRC, pursuant to section 751(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (&#x201C;Act&#x201D;).<sup>

        </p>
        
        <p id="p-7" data-page="62764">The Department conducted an expedited sunset review of these orders.<sup>
        [2]
      </sup>
          As a result of its review, the Department found that revocation of the antidumping duty orders would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and, thus, notified the ITC of the magnitude of the margins likely to prevail if the orders were revoked.<sup>
        [3]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="p-10" data-page="62764">On October 6, 2010, the ITC published its determination, pursuant to section 751(c) of the Act, which stated that revocation of the antidumping duty orders on chlorinated isos from Spain and the PRC would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States within a reasonably foreseeable time.<sup>

<br><p><b>Scope of the Orders 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-12" data-page="62764">The products covered by the orders are chlorinated isos, which are derivatives of cyanuric acid, described as chlorinated s-triazine triones. There are three primary chemical compositions of chlorinated isos: (1) Trichloroisocyanuric acid (Cl <sub>3</sub> (NCO) <sub>3</sub>), (2) sodium dichloroisocyanurate (dihydrate) (NaCl <sub>2</sub> (NCO) <sub>3</sub> (2H <sub>2</sub> O)), and (3) sodium dichloroisocyanurate (anhydrous) (NaCl <sub>2</sub> (NCO) <sub>3</sub>). Chlorinated isos are available in powder, granular, and tableted forms. The orders cover all chlorinated isos. Chlorinated isos are currently classifiable under subheadings 2933.69.6015, 2933.69.6021, 2933.69.6050, 3808.40.50, 3808.50.40 and 3808.94.50.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (&#x201C;HTSUS&#x201D;).<sup>
        [5]
      </sup>
          The tariff classification 2933.69.6015 covers sodium dichloroisocyanurates (anhydrous and dihydrate forms) and trichloroisocyanuric acid. The tariff classifications 2933.69.6021 and 2933.69.6050 represent basket categories that include chlorinated isos and other compounds including an unfused triazine ring. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description of the scope of the orders is dispositive.</p>

        <p id="p-14" data-page="62764">As a result of the determinations by the Department and the ITC that revocation of the antidumping duty orders would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, pursuant to section 751(d)(2) of the Act, the Department hereby orders the continuation of these antidumping duty orders on chlorinated isos from Spain and the PRC. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will continue to collect antidumping duty cash deposits at the rates in effect at the time of entry for all imports of subject merchandise.
