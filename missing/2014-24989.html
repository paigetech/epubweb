<br><p><b>I. Listing of New Acceptable Substitutes 
</b></p>


        <p data-page="62863" id="p-18">This action presents EPA&apos;s most recent decision to list as acceptable several substitutes in the refrigeration and air conditioning, foam blowing, and fire suppression and explosion protection sectors. New substitutes include <i>trans</i>-1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-ene in non-mechanical heat transfer, and in flexible polyurethane foams; CO <sub>2</sub> in refrigerated transport; R-450A in a variety of refrigeration and air conditioning end-uses; methylal and hydrofluoroolefin (HFO)-1336mzz(Z) in a variety of foam blowing end-uses; and Powdered Aerosol D in the total flooding end-use. For copies of the full list of acceptable substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODS) in all industrial sectors, visit EPA&apos;s Ozone Layer Protection Web site at <i>www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/lists/index.html.</i>
        </p>

        <p data-page="62863" id="p-19">The sections below discuss each substitute listing in detail. Appendix A contains tables summarizing today&apos;s listing decisions for these new acceptable substitutes. The statements in the &#x201C;Further Information&#x201D; column in the tables provide additional information, but are not legally binding<span data-page="62864" id="page-62864"> </span>under section 612 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). In addition, the &#x201C;Further Information&#x201D; may not be a comprehensive list of other legal obligations you may need to meet when using the substitute. Although you are not required to follow recommendations in the &#x201C;Further Information&#x201D; column of the table to use a substitute consistent with section 612 of the CAA, some of these statements may refer to obligations that are enforceable or binding under federal or state programs other than the SNAP program. In many instances, the information simply refers to standard operating practices in existing industry and/or building-code standards. EPA strongly encourages you to apply the information in this column using these substitutes. Many of these recommendations, if adopted, would not require significant changes to existing operating practices.</p>

          Estimates of this compound&apos;s potential to deplete the ozone layer indicate that even with worst-case estimates of emissions, which assume that this compound would substitute for all compounds it could replace, the impact on global atmospheric ozone abundance would be statistically insignificant.<sup>
            [4]
          </sup>
          Solstice <sup>TM</sup> 1233zd(E) has a 100-year integrated global warming potential (100-yr GWP) reported as 1 to 7 and an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 26 to 31 days or less. <sup>5 6 7</sup>
          Solstice <sup>TM</sup> 1233zd(E) is excluded from the definition of volatile organic compounds (VOC) under CAA regulations (see 40 CFR 51.100(s)) addressing the development of state implementation plans (SIPs) to attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The emissions of this refrigerant will be limited, given that it is subject to the venting prohibition under section 608(c)(2) of the CAA and EPA&apos;s venting regulations codified at 40 CFR 82.154(a)(1).</p>

        <p data-page="62864" id="p-34">
          <i>Toxicity and exposure data:</i> Potential health effects of this substitute include serious eye irritation, skin irritation, and frostbite. It may cause central nervous system effects such as drowsiness and dizziness. The substitute could cause asphyxiation if air is displaced by vapors in a confined space.</p>

        <p data-page="62864" id="p-35">The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has established a Workplace Environmental Exposure Level (WEEL) of 800 ppm for <i>trans</i>-1-chloro-3,3,3,-trifluoroprop-1-ene. EPA anticipates that Solstice <sup>TM</sup> 1233zd(E) will be used in a manner consistent with the recommendations specified in the manufacturer&apos;s material safety data sheet (MSDS). EPA anticipates that users will be able to meet the WEEL and address potential health risks by following requirements and recommendations in the MSDS and in any other safety precautions common to the refrigeration and air conditioning industry.</p>
        <p data-page="62864" id="p-36">
          <i>Comparison to other substitutes in these end-uses:</i> Solstice <sup>TM</sup> 1233zd(E) has an ODP of 0.00024 to 0.00034 and estimates of its maximum potential impact on the ozone layer indicate a statistically insignificant impact, comparable to that of other substitutes in the same end-uses that are considered to be non-ozone-depleting.<sup>
            [8]
          </sup>
          Solstice <sup>TM</sup> 1233zd(E)&apos;s ODP is well below those of ODS in these end-uses, such as chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-113, HCFC-141b, HCFC-22, and HCFC-123 (with ODPs ranging from 0.01 to 0.8<sup>
            [9]
          </sup>
          ). Solstice <sup>TM</sup> 1233zd(E)&apos;s GWP of 1 to 7 is lower than or comparable to those of other acceptable substitutes in the same end-uses, such as HFC-245fa, HFC-134a and HFC-125 (with GWPs ranging from 1,030 to 3,500<sup>
            [10]
          </sup>

          ). Its GWP is also well below those of CFC-113, HCFC-141b, HCFC-22, and HCFC-123 (with GWPs ranging from 77 to 4,750). Flammability risks are low, as discussed above. Toxicity risks can be minimized by use consistent with the AIHA WEEL standard, the American Society for Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 15 and other industry standards, recommendations in the MSDS, and other safety precautions common in the refrigeration and air conditioning industry. The potential health effects of Solstice <sup>TM</sup> 1233zd(E) are common to many refrigerants, including many of those already listed as acceptable under SNAP. EPA thus<span data-page="62865" id="page-62865"> </span>finds <i>trans-</i> 1 <i>-</i> chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-ene (Solstice <sup>TM</sup> 1233zd(E)) acceptable in the end-uses listed above, because the overall environmental and human health risk posed by <i>trans</i>-1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-ene is lower than or comparable to the risks posed by other substitutes found acceptable in the same end-uses.</p>

        <p data-page="62868" id="p-118">
          <i>Comparison to other foam blowing agents:</i> HFO-1336mzz(Z) has an ODP of zero, comparable to a number of other acceptable non-ozone-depleting substitutes for these end uses such as HFC-134a, HFC-245fa, HFC-152a, and C3-C6 saturated light hydrocarbons and in contrast to CFC-11, CFC-113, HCFC-141b, and HCFC-22 (with ODPs ranging from 0.04 to 1.0). HFO-1336mzz(Z)&apos;s GWP of about 9 is lower than or comparable to those of other acceptable substitutes in the same end uses for which we are finding it acceptable, such as HFC-134a, HFC-245fa, and HFC-152a (with GWPs ranging from 124 to 1,430), C3-C6 saturated light hydrocarbons (with GWPs less than 10), and Solstice-1233zd(E) with a GWP of 1 to 7 (see listing B.1 above and <!!ln dp_fr77 77-FR-47772p77 #77-FR-47772p77>77 FR 47772</a>). Further, the GWP of HFO-1336mzz(Z) is less than those of CFC-11, CFC-113, HCFC-141b, and HCFC-22, with GWPs ranging from 725 to 4,750. Flammability risks are low, as discussed above. Toxicity risks can be minimized by use consistent with the manufacturer&apos;s recommended AEL, recommendations in the MSDS, and other safety precautions common in the foam blowing industry. The potential health effects of HFO-1336mzz(Z) are common to many foam blowing agents, including many of those already listed as acceptable under SNAP. EPA thus finds HFO-1336mzz(Z) acceptable in the end uses listed above, because the overall environmental and human health risk posed by HFO-1336mzz(Z) is lower than or comparable to the risks posed by other substitutes found acceptable in the same end uses.</p>

        <p data-page="62868" id="p-119">
          <i>EPA&apos;s decision: EPA finds Powdered Aerosol D acceptable as a substitute for total flooding uses.</i>
        </p>
        
        <p data-page="62868" id="p-120">Powdered Aerosol D is a pyrotechnic particulate aerosol and explosion suppressant that also is marketed under the trade names of Aero-K&#xAE; and Stat-X&#xAE;. This fire suppressant is supplied to users as a solid housed in a double-walled hermetically-sealed steel container. When the unit is triggered by heat (300 &#xB0;C), the product is pyrotechnically activated to produce gases and aerosol particles from a mixture of chemicals. EPA previously listed Powdered Aerosol D as acceptable subject to use conditions (<!!ln dp_fr71 71-FR-56359p71 #71-FR-56359p71>71 FR 56359</a>; September 7, 2006). The use conditions require that Powdered Aerosol D be used only in areas that are not normally occupied, on the basis of information supporting its safe use in areas that are not normally occupied. Based on a review of additional information from the submitter to support the safe use of Powdered Aerosol D in normally occupied spaces, EPA now determines that Powdered Aerosol D is also acceptable for use in total flooding systems for normally occupied spaces. The listing will provide that Powdered Aerosol D is acceptable for total flooding uses, which would include both unoccupied and occupied spaces. In a subsequent rulemaking EPA will remove the previous listing as acceptable subject to use conditions. In the &#x201C;Further Information&#x201D; column of the tables summarizing today&apos;s listing decisions and found at the end of this document, we also state that use of this agent should continue to be in accordance with the safety guidelines in the latest edition of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 2010 Standard for Aerosol Extinguishing Systems.</p>

        <p data-page="62868" id="p-121">You may find the redacted submission in Docket item EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0118 at <i>www.regulations.gov</i> under the name, &#x201C;8/8/13 letter from Marc Gross, Fireaway to Rebecca von dem Hagen, EPA and SNAP Information Notice for Stat-X.&#x201D; EPA has performed an assessment to examine the health and environmental risks of this substitute. This assessment is available in docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0118 under the name, &#x201C;Risk Screen on Substitutes for Total Flooding Systems in Normally Occupied Spaces&#x2014;Substitute: Powdered Aerosol D (Stat-X&#xAE;).&#x201D;</p>
        <p data-page="62868" id="p-122">
          <i>Environmental information:</i> The active ingredients of Powdered Aerosol D are solids both before and after use; thus, their ODP and GWP are both zero. The gaseous post-activation products for Powdered Aerosol D also have zero ODP and GWPs of 25 or less. The solid active ingredients and particulate post-activation products do not participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions and are not VOCs. The gaseous post-activation products are excluded from the definition of VOC under CAA regulations (see 40 CFR 51.100(s)) addressing the development of SIPs to attain and maintain the NAAQS.</p>
        <p data-page="62868" id="p-123">None of the pre- or post-activation constituents of Powdered Aerosol D will exist in quantities approaching the respective reporting quantities under the Clean Water Act for priority or toxic pollutants. During post-activation clean-up procedures, clean-up residues should be disposed of in accordance with requirements appropriate for those materials, as outlined in the agent&apos;s MSDS and local, state, and federal regulations.</p>
        <p data-page="62868" id="p-124">
          <i>Flammability information:</i> Powdered Aerosol D&apos;s post-activation products are nonflammable.</p>
        <p data-page="62868" id="p-125">
          <i>Toxicity and exposure data:</i> Exposure to Powdered Aerosol D after activation may cause temporary, mild irritation of the mucous membrane. If eye or skin contact occurs, end users should flush eyes with water or wash skin with soap and water. Exposure to the post-discharge products is expected to be below the relevant workplace exposure limits for those compounds. Because it is housed in a hermetically sealed container, exposure should not occur unless the system is activated.</p>
        <p data-page="62868" id="p-126">
          <i>Information on additional safety recommendations:</i> The discharge of the aerosol results in a reduction of visibility in the protected space due to the uniform distribution of the particulate generated. Use according to the NFPA 2010 Standard will further reduce any safety risks due to reduced visibility. In addition, EPA recommends that cross-zone detection systems and<span data-page="62869" id="page-62869"> </span>abort switches located near an exit from the protected space be employed.</p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-127">In the &#x201C;Further Information&#x201D; column of the tables summarizing today&apos;s listing decisions, EPA recommends the following for establishments manufacturing Powdered Aerosol D and filling containers to be used in total flooding applications:</p>
        
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-128">&#x2014;Workers should use appropriate safety and protective equipment (e.g., protective gloves, tightly sealed goggles, protective work clothing, and particulate-removing respirators using NIOSH type N95 or better filters) consistent with OSHA guidelines.</p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-129">&#x2014;A local exhaust system should be installed and operated to provide adequate ventilation to reduce airborne exposure to Powdered Aerosol D constituents.</p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-130">&#x2014;An eye wash fountain and quick drench facility should be close to the production area.</p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-131">&#x2014;Training for safe handling procedures should be provided to all employees that would be likely to handle the containers of the agent or extinguishing units filled with the agent.</p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-132">&#x2014;Workers responsible for cleanup should allow particulates to settle before reentering area and wear appropriate personal protective equipment.</p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-133">&#x2014;All spills should be cleaned up immediately in accordance with good industrial hygiene practices.</p>
        
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-134">EPA expects that procedures identified in the MSDS for Powdered Aerosol D and good manufacturing practices will be adhered to, and that the appropriate safety and personal protective equipment (PPE) consistent with OSHA guidelines will be used during installation, servicing, post-discharge clean-up and disposal of total flooding systems using Powdered Aerosol D. The manufacturer should provide guidance upon installation of the system regarding the appropriate time after which workers may re-enter the area for disposal to allow the maximum settling of all particulates.</p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-135">
          <i>Comparison to other substitutes in this end use:</i> Powdered Aerosol D has zero ODP, both prior to and after activation. In comparison, Halon 1301 has an ODP of 12 and other acceptable substitutes used in this end use, such as HCFC Blend A, HFC-227ea, and HFC-125 have ODPs of 0.048, zero and zero. The active ingredients of Powdered Aerosol D have a GWP of zero prior to activation and the gaseous post-activation products have a GWP of 25 or less. In comparison, Halon 1301 has a GWP of 7,140 and other acceptable substitutes used in this end use, such as HCFC Blend A, HFC-227ea, and HFC-125 have GWPs of about 1,550, 3,220, and 3,500, respectively. Toxicity risks can be minimized by use consistent with the NFPA 2010 standard, recommendations in the MSDS, and other safety precautions common in the fire suppression industry. The potential health effects of Powdered Aerosol D are common to many fire suppressants, including many of those already listed as acceptable under SNAP. EPA thus finds Powdered Aerosol D acceptable in the total flooding end-use because it does not pose a greater overall risk to human health and the environment than other acceptable substitutes in this end-use.</p>
        
<br><p><b>II. Section 612Program 
</b></p>

        <br><p><b>A. Statutory Requirements and Authority for the SNAP Program</b></p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-136">Section 612 of the CAA requires EPA to develop a program for evaluating alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. EPA refers to this program as the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. The major provisions of section 612 are:</p>
        <br><p><b>1. Rulemaking</b></p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-137">Section 612(c) requires EPA to promulgate rules making it unlawful to replace any class I substance (e.g., chlorofluorocarbon, halon, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and hydrobromofluorocarbon) or class II substance (e.g., hydrochlorofluorocarbon) with any substitute that the Administrator determines may present adverse effects to human health or the environment where the Administrator has identified an alternative that (1) reduces the overall risk to human health and the environment, and (2) is currently or potentially available.</p>
        <br><p><b>2. Listing of Unacceptable/Acceptable Substitutes</b></p>

        <p data-page="62869" id="p-138">Section 612(c) requires EPA to publish a list of the substitutes unacceptable for specific uses and to publish a corresponding list of acceptable alternatives for specific uses. The list of &#x201C;acceptable&#x201D; substitutes is found at <i>www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/lists</i> and the lists of &#x201C;unacceptable,&#x201D; &#x201C;acceptable subject to use conditions,&#x201D; and &#x201C;acceptable subject to narrowed use limits&#x201D; substitutes are found in the appendices to 40 CFR part 82, subpart G.</p>
        <br><p><b>3. Petition Process</b></p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-139">Section 612(d) grants the right to any person to petition EPA to add a substance to, or delete a substance from, the lists published in accordance with section 612(c). The agency has 90 days to grant or deny a petition. Where the agency grants the petition, the EPA must publish the revised lists within an additional six months.</p>
        <br><p><b>4. 90-Day Notification</b></p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-140">Section 612(e) directs EPA to require any person who produces a chemical substitute for a class I substance to notify the agency not less than 90 days before new or existing chemicals are introduced into interstate commerce for significant new uses as substitutes for a class I substance. The producer must also provide the agency with the producer&apos;s unpublished health and safety studies on such substitutes.</p>
        <br><p><b>5. Outreach</b></p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-141">Section 612(b)(1) states that the Administrator shall seek to maximize the use of federal research facilities and resources to assist users of class I and II substances in identifying and developing alternatives to the use of such substances in key commercial applications.</p>
        <br><p><b>6. Clearinghouse</b></p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-142">Section 612(b)(4) requires the agency to set up a public clearinghouse of alternative chemicals, product substitutes, and alternative manufacturing processes that are available for products and manufacturing processes which use class I and II substances.</p>
        <br><p><b>B. EPA&apos;s Regulations Implementing Section 612</b></p>
        <p data-page="62869" id="p-143">On March 18, 1994, EPA published the original rulemaking (59 FR 13044) which established the process for administering the SNAP program and issued EPA&apos;s first lists identifying acceptable and unacceptable substitutes in the major industrial use sectors (subpart G of 40 CFR part 82). These sectors are the following: Refrigeration and air conditioning; foam blowing; solvents cleaning; fire suppression and explosion protection; sterilants; aerosols; adhesives, coatings and inks; and tobacco expansion. These sectors comprise the principal industrial sectors that historically consumed the largest volumes of ODS.</p>

        <p data-page="62869" id="p-144">Section 612 of the CAA requires EPA to list as acceptable those substitutes that do not present a significantly greater risk to human health and the environment as compared with other substitutes that are currently or potentially available.<span data-page="62870" id="page-62870"> </span>
        </p>
        <br><p><b>C. How the Regulations for the SNAP Program Work</b></p>
        <p data-page="62870" id="p-145">Under the SNAP regulations, anyone who plans to market or produce a substitute to replace a class I substance or class II substance in one of the eight major industrial use sectors must provide the Agency with notice and the required health and safety information on the substitute at least 90 days before introducing it into interstate commerce for significant new use as an alternative. 40 CFR 82.176(a). While this requirement typically applies to chemical manufacturers as the person likely to be planning to introduce the substitute into interstate commerce,<sup>
            [18]
          </sup>
          it may also apply to importers, formulators, equipment manufacturers, and end-users<sup>
            [19]
          </sup>
          when they are responsible for introducing a substitute into commerce. The 90-day SNAP review process begins once EPA receives the submission and determines that the submission includes complete and adequate data. 40 CFR 82.180(a). The CAA and the SNAP regulations, 40 CFR 82.174(a), prohibit use of a substitute earlier than 90 days after notice has been provided to the Agency.</p>
        
        
        <p data-page="62870" id="p-148">The agency has identified four possible decision categories for substitute submissions: acceptable; acceptable subject to use conditions; acceptable subject to narrowed use limits; and unacceptable.<sup>
            [20]
          </sup>
          40 CFR 82.180(b). Use conditions and narrowed use limits are both considered &#x201C;use restrictions&#x201D; and are explained below. Substitutes that are deemed acceptable without use conditions may be used for all applications within the relevant end-uses within the sector and without limits under SNAP on how they may be used. Substitutes that are acceptable subject to use restrictions may be used only in accordance with those restrictions. Substitutes that are found to be unacceptable may not be used after the date specified in the rulemaking adding such substitute to the list of unacceptable substitutes.<sup>
            [21]
          </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        
        <p data-page="62870" id="p-151">After reviewing a substitute, the agency may make a determination that a substitute is acceptable only if certain conditions in the way that the substitute is used are met to minimize risks to human health and the environment. EPA describes such substitutes as &#x201C;acceptable subject to use conditions.&#x201D; Entities that use these substitutes without meeting the associated use conditions are in violation of EPA&apos;s SNAP regulations. 40 CFR 82.174(c).</p>
        <p data-page="62870" id="p-152">For some substitutes, the Agency may permit a narrowed range of use within an end-use or sector. For example, the Agency may limit the use of a substitute to certain end-uses or specific applications within an industry sector. The Agency requires a user of a narrowed use substitute to demonstrate that no other acceptable substitutes are available for their specific application. The EPA describes these substitutes as &#x201C;acceptable subject to narrowed use limits.&#x201D; A person using a substitute that is acceptable subject to narrowed use limits in applications and end-uses that are not consistent with the narrowed use limit is using the substitute in violation of section 612 of the CAA and EPA&apos;s SNAP regulations. 40 CFR 82.174(c).</p>
        <p data-page="62870" id="p-153">The section 612 mandate for EPA to prohibit the use of a substitute that may present risk to human health or the environment where a lower risk alternative is available or potentially available<sup>
            [22]
          </sup>
          provides EPA with the authority to change the listing status of a particular substitute if such a change is justified by new information or changed circumstance.</p>
        

        <p data-page="62870" id="p-155">As described in this document and elsewhere, including the original SNAP rulemaking published in the <span>Federal Register</span> at 59 FR 13044 on March 18, 1994, the SNAP program evaluates substitutes within a comparative risk framework. The SNAP program compares new substitutes both to the ozone-depleting substances being phased out under the <i>Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer</i> and the CAA and to other available or potentially available alternatives for the same end uses. The environmental and health risk factors that the SNAP program considers include ozone depletion potential, flammability, toxicity, occupational and consumer health and safety, as well as contributions to global warming and other environmental factors. Environmental and human health exposures can vary significantly depending on the particular application of a substitute&#x2014;and over time, information applicable to a substitute can change. This approach does not imply fundamental tradeoffs with respect to different types of risk, either to the environment or to human health. EPA recognizes that during the two-decade long history of the SNAP program, new alternatives and new information about alternatives have emerged. To the extent possible, EPA considers new information and improved understanding of the risk factors for the environment and human health in the context of the available or potentially available alternatives for a given use.</p>
        <p data-page="62870" id="p-156">The agency publishes its SNAP program decisions in the <span>Federal Register</span>. EPA uses notice-and-comment rulemaking to place any alternative on the list of prohibited substitutes, to list a substitute as acceptable only subject to use conditions or narrowed use limits, or to remove a substitute from either the list of prohibited or acceptable substitutes.</p>
        <p data-page="62870" id="p-157">In contrast, EPA publishes &#x201C;notices of acceptability&#x201D; or &#x201C;determinations of acceptability,&#x201D; to notify the public of substitutes that are deemed acceptable with no restrictions. As described in the preamble to the rule initially implementing the SNAP program (59 FR 13044; March 18, 1994), EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are necessary to list alternatives that are acceptable without restrictions because such listings neither impose any sanction nor prevent anyone from using a substitute.</p>

        <p data-page="62870" id="p-158">Many SNAP listings include &#x201C;comments&#x201D; or &#x201C;further information&#x201D; to provide additional information on substitutes. Since this additional information is not part of the regulatory decision, these statements are not binding for use of the substitute under<span data-page="62871" id="page-62871"> </span>the SNAP program. However, regulatory requirements so listed are binding under other regulatory programs (e.g., worker protection regulations promulgated by OSHA). The &#x201C;further information&#x201D; classification does not necessarily include all other legal obligations pertaining to the use of the substitute. While the items listed are not legally binding under the SNAP program, EPA encourages users of substitutes to apply all statements in the &#x201C;further information&#x201D; column in their use of these substitutes. In many instances, the information simply refers to sound operating practices that have already been identified in existing industry and/or building codes or standards. Thus many of the statements, if adopted, would not require the affected user to make significant changes in existing operating practices.</p>
