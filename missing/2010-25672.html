        <p id="p-1" data-page="62807">The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for the Princeton Lateral Project proposed by Northern Border Pipeline Company (Northern Border) in the above referenced docket. Northern Border requests authorization to construct pipeline facilities to transport natural gas from Northern Border&apos;s existing pipeline system in Bureau County, Illinois to an interconnection with Central Illinois Light Company d/b/a/AmerenCILCO (CILCO) near Princeton, Illinois.</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="62807">The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the Princeton Lateral Project in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The FERC staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="62807">The proposed Princeton Lateral Project includes the following facilities:</p>
        <ul><li id="p-4" data-page="62807"> 8.65 miles of 16-inch-diameter natural gas lateral<sup>

        <ul><li id="p-6" data-page="62807"> a pig<sup>
        [2]
      </sup>
          launcher assembly located adjacent to the Northern Border Kasbeer side valve site; and</li></ul>
        
        <ul><li id="p-8" data-page="62807"> metering and associated facilities at the CILCO delivery location.</li></ul>

        <p id="p-9" data-page="62807">The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public viewing on the FERC&apos;s Web site at <i>http://www.ferc.gov</i> using the
