<br><p><b>Consultation 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-8" data-page="75908">A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by University of California professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Barona Reservation, California; Campo Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Campo Indian Reservation, California; Ewiiaapaayp Band of Kumeyaay Indians, California; Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel, California (formerly the Santa Ysabel Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Santa Ysabel Reservation); Inaja Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Inaja and Cosmit Reservation, California; Jamul Indian Village of California; La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California; Manzanita Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Manzanita Reservation, California; Mesa Grande Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the Mesa Grande Reservation, California; San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of California; Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation; and the Viejas (Baron Long) Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians of the Viejas Reservation, California (herein after referred to as &#x201C;The Tribes&#x201D;).</p>
        
<br><p><b>History and Description of the Remains 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-9" data-page="75908">In 1976, human remains representing, at minimum, two individuals were removed from the University of California, San Diego&apos;s University House site, in San Diego, CA. The site is variously referred to as the Black, William House; SDM-W-12A (as recorded by the San Diego Museum of Man); CA-SDI-4669 (as recorded with the State of California); and NPS No.: 08000343. No known individuals were identified. The approximately 25 associated funerary objects consist of shell, stone, charcoal, and bone.</p>
        
<br><p><b>Determinations Made by the University of California, San Diego 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-10" data-page="75908">Officials of the University of California, San Diego have determined that:</p>
        <ul>
<li id="p-11" data-page="75908"> The calibrated dates for the human remains are believed to fall between 8,977 and 9,603 years B.P.</li>
        <li id="p-12" data-page="75908"> The human remains are Native American.</li>
        <li id="p-13" data-page="75908"> Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(2), a relationship of shared group identity cannot be reasonably traced between the Native American human remains and any present-day Indian tribe.</li>
        <li id="p-14" data-page="75908"> Evidence indicates that the land from which the Native American human remains were removed is the aboriginal land of the Diegueno (Kumeyaay) Tribe. As noted in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions, on or about January 7, 1852, the Diegueno (Kumeyaay) ceded to the United States an area that includes present-day San Diego County.</li>
        <li id="p-15" data-page="75908"> The present-day descendants of the Diegueno (Kumeyaay) are The Tribes.</li>

        <li id="p-16" data-page="75908"> Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(9), the human remains described in this notice represent the physical remains of two

individuals of Native American ancestry.</li>
        <li id="p-17" data-page="75909"> Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001(3)(A), the approximately 25 objects described above are reasonably believed to have been placed with or near individual human remains at the time of death or later as part of the death rite or ceremony.</li>
        <li id="p-18" data-page="75909"> Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1), and based upon request from the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee, on behalf of The Tribes, disposition of the human remains is to the La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California.</li>
</ul>
        
<br><p><b>Additional Requestors and Disposition 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-19" data-page="75909">Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains or any other Indian tribe that believes it satisfies the criteria in 43 CFR 10.11(c)(1) should contact Gary C. Matthews, Vice Chancellor Resource Management  Planning, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive #0057, La Jolla, CA 92093-0057, telephone (858) 534-6820, before January 4, 2012. Disposition of the human remains to the La Posta Band of Diegueno Mission Indians of the La Posta Indian Reservation, California may proceed after that date if no additional requestors come forward.</p>
