<br><p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
</b></p>
<br><p><b>I. Abstract 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-7" data-page="62762">This request is for a new information collection.</p>

        <p id="p-8" data-page="62762">The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) proposes to collect demographic, cultural, economic, and social information about the snapper-grouper fisheries in the U.S. Caribbean. The proposed survey also intends to inquire about industry&apos;s perceptions, attitudes and beliefs regarding the potential use of catch shares to manage these fisheries. The data gathered will be used to describe the current socio-economic condition of the fishery and offer insight into fishermen&apos;s concerns about a potential catch share program, which could be used to better tailor a potential program. In addition, the information collected will be used to strengthen and improve fishery management decision-making, satisfy legal mandates under Executive Order 12866, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (U.S.C. 1801 <i>et seq.</i>), the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act, and other pertinent statutes.</p>
        
<br><p><b>II. Method of Collection
