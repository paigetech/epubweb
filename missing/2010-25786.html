    <p id="p-3" data-page="62810">Since 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has maintained a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket (the &#x201C;Docket&#x201D;) under Section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Section 120(c) requires EPA to establish a Docket that contains certain information reported to EPA by Federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which a reportable quantity of hazardous substances has been released. The Docket is used to identify Federal facilities that should be evaluated to determine if they pose a threat to public health or welfare and the environment and to provide a mechanism to make this information available to the public. The Docket contains information that is submitted by Federal facilities under the following authorities: CERCLA Section 103 and RCRA Sections 3005, 3010 and 3016. EPA is required to publish a list of newly reported facilities in the

<br><p><b>1.0 Introduction 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-15" data-page="62810">Section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) 9620(c), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket (&#x201C;Docket&#x201D;). The Docket contains information on Federal facilities that is submitted by Federal agencies to EPA under Sections 3005, 3010, and 3016 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6925, 6930, and 6937, and under Section 103 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9603. Specifically, RCRA Section 3005 establishes a permitting system for certain hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) facilities; RCRA Section 3010 requires waste generators, transporters and TSD facilities to notify EPA of their hazardous waste activities; and RCRA Section 3016 requires Federal agencies to submit biennially to EPA an inventory of their Federal hazardous waste facilities. CERCLA Section 103(a) requires the owner or operator of a vessel or onshore or offshore facility to notify the National Response Center (NRC) of any spill or other release of a hazardous substance that equals or exceeds a reportable quantity (RQ), as defined by CERCLA Section 101. Additionally, CERCLA Section 103(c) requires facilities that have &#x201C;stored, treated, or disposed of&#x201D; hazardous wastes and where there is &#x201C;known, suspected, or likely releases&#x201D; of hazardous substances to report their activities to EPA.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="62810">The Docket serves three major purposes: (1) To identify all Federal facilities that must be evaluated to determine whether they pose a risk to human health and the environment sufficient to warrant inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL); (2) to compile and maintain the information submitted to EPA on such facilities under the provisions listed in Section 120(c) of CERCLA; and (3) to provide a mechanism to make the information available to the public.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="62810">The initial list of Federal facilities to be included on the Docket was published in the Federal Register on February 12, 1988 (53 FR 4280). Since then, updates to the Docket have been published on November 16, 1988 (54 FR 46364); December 15, 1989 (54 FR 51472); August 22, 1990 (55 FR 34492); September 27, 1991 (56 FR 49328); December 12, 1991 (56 FR 64898); July 17, 1992 (57 FR 31758); February 5, 1993 (58 FR 7298); November 10, 1993 (58 FR 59790); April 11, 1995 (<!!ln dp_fr60 60-FR-18474p60 #60-FR-18474p60>60 FR 18474</a>); June 27, 1997 (<!!ln dp_fr62 62-FR-34779p62 #62-FR-34779p62>62 FR 34779</a>); November 23, 1998 (<!!ln dp_fr63 63-FR-64806p63 #63-FR-64806p63>63 FR 64806</a>); June 12, 2000 (<!!ln dp_fr65 65-FR-36994p65 #65-FR-36994p65>65 FR 36994</a>); December 29, 2000 (<!!ln dp_fr65 65-FR-83222p65 #65-FR-83222p65>65 FR 83222</a>); October 2, 2001 (<!!ln dp_fr66 66-FR-50185p66 #66-FR-50185p66>66 FR 50185</a>); July 1, 2002 (<!!ln dp_fr67 67-FR-44200p67 #67-FR-44200p67>67 FR 44200</a>); January 2, 2003 (<!!ln dp_fr68 68-FR-107p68 #68-FR-107p68>68 FR 107</a>); July 11, 2003 (<!!ln dp_fr68 68-FR-41353p68 #68-FR-41353p68>68 FR 41353</a>); December 15, 2003 (<!!ln dp_fr68 68-FR-240p68 #68-FR-240p68>68 FR 240</a>); July 19, 2004 (<!!ln dp_fr69 69-FR-42989p69 #69-FR-42989p69>69 FR 42989</a>); December 20, 2004 (<!!ln dp_fr69 69-FR-75951p69 #69-FR-75951p69>69 FR 75951</a>); October 25, 2005 (<!!ln dp_fr70 70-FR-61616p70 #70-FR-61616p70>70 FR 61616</a>); August 17, 2007 (<!!ln dp_fr72 72-FR-46218p72 #72-FR-46218p72>72 FR 46218</a>); and November 25, 2008 (<!!ln dp_fr73 73-FR-228p73 #73-FR-228p73>73 FR 228</a>).

<br><p><b>3.0 Revisions of the Previous Docket 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-32" data-page="62811">This section includes a discussion of the additions, deletions, and corrections to the list of Docket facilities since the previous Docket update.</p>
        <br><p><b>3.1 Additions</b></p>
        <p id="p-33" data-page="62811">Today, 57 Federal facilities are being added to the Docket, primarily because of new information obtained by EPA (for example, recent reporting of a facility pursuant to RCRA Sections 3005, 3010, or 3016 or CERCLA Section 103). CERCLA Section 120, as amended by the Defense Authorization Act of 1997, specifies that EPA take steps to assure that a Preliminary Assessment (PA) be completed within a reasonable time frame for those Federal facilities that are included on the Docket. Among other things, the PA is designed to provide information for EPA to consider when evaluating the site for potential response action or listing on the NPL.</p>
        <br><p><b>3.2 Deletions</b></p>

        <p id="p-34" data-page="62811">Today, 31 Federal facilities are being deleted from the Docket. There are no statutory or regulatory provisions that address deletion of a facility from the Docket. However, if a facility is incorrectly included on the Docket, it may be deleted from the Docket; this may be appropriate for a facility for which there was an incorrect report submitted for hazardous waste activity under RCRA (<i>e.g.,</i> 40 CFR 262.44); a facility that was not Federally-owned or operated at the time of the listing; facilities included more than once (<i>i.e.,</i> redundant listings); or when multiple facilities are combined under one listing. Facilities being deleted no longer will be subject to the requirements of CERCLA Section 120(d).</p>
        <br><p><b>3.3 Corrections</b></p>
        <p id="p-35" data-page="62811">Changes necessary to correct the previous Docket are identified by both EPA and Federal agencies. The corrections section may include changes in addresses or spelling, and corrections of the recorded name and ownership of a Federal facility. In addition, changes in the names of Federal facilities may be made to establish consistency in the Docket or between CERCLIS and the Docket. For the Federal facility for which a correction is entered, the original entry (designated by an &#x201C;o&#x201D;), as it appeared in previous Docket updates, is shown directly below the corrected entry (designated by a &#x201C;c&#x201D;) for easy comparison. Today, information is being corrected for one (1) facility.</p>
        
<br><p><b>4.0 Process for Compiling the Updated Docket 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-36" data-page="62811">In compiling the newly reported Federal facilities for the update being published today, EPA extracted the names, addresses, and identification numbers of facilities from four EPA databases&#x2014;the Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS), the Biennial Inventory of Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Activities, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Information System (RCRAInfo), and CERCLIS&#x2014;that contain information about Federal facilities submitted under the four provisions listed in CERCLA Section 120(c).</p>
        <p id="p-37" data-page="62811">EPA assures the quality of the information on the Docket by conducting extensive evaluation of the current Docket list with the information obtained from the databases identified above to determine which Federal facilities were, in fact, newly reported and qualified for inclusion on the update. EPA is also striving to correct errors for Federal facilities that were previously reported. For example, state-owned or privately-owned facilities that are not operated by the Federal government may have been included. Such problems are sometimes caused by procedures historically used to report and track Federal facilities data. Representatives of Federal agencies are asked to write to the EPA HQ Docket Coordinator at the following address if revisions of this update information are necessary: Tim Mott, Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket Coordinator, Federal Facilities Restoration and Reuse Office (Mail Code 5106P), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p>
        
<br><p><b>5.0 Facilities Not Included 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-38" data-page="62811">Certain categories of facilities may not be included on the Docket, such as: (1) Federal facilities formerly owned by a Federal agency that at the time of consideration was not Federally-owned or operated; (2) Federal facilities that are small quantity generators (SQGs) that have never generated more than 1,000 kg of hazardous waste in any month; (3) Federal facilities that are solely hazardous waste transportation facilities, as reported under RCRA Section 3010; and (4) Federal facilities that have mixed mine or mill site ownership. An EPA policy issued in June 2003 provided guidance for a site-by-site evaluation as to whether &#x201C;mixed ownership&#x201D; mine or mill sites, typically created as a result of activities conducted pursuant to the General Mining Law of 1872 and never reported
:::index 75p62812

under Section 103(a), should be included on the Docket. For purposes of that policy, mixed ownership mine or mill sites are those located partially on private land and partially on public land. This policy is found at <i>http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/pdf/mixownrshpmine.pdf</i>. The policy for not including these facilities may change; facilities now not included may be added at some point if EPA determines that they should be included.</p>
        
<br><p><b>6.0 Facility NPL Status Reporting, Including NFRAP Status 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-39" data-page="62812">EPA typically tracks the NPL status of Federal facilities listed on the Docket. An updated list of the NPL status of all Docket facilities, as well as their NFRAP status, is available at <i>http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/documents/docket.htm</i> or by contacting Tim Mott, Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket Coordinator, Federal Facilities Restoration and Reuse Office (Mail Code 5106P), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20460. In prior updates, information regarding NFRAP status changes was provided separately.</p>
        
<br><p><b>7.0 Information Contained on Docket Listing 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-40" data-page="62812">The updated information is provided in three tables. The first table is a list of new Federal facilities that are being added on the Docket; the second table is a list of Federal facilities that are being deleted from the Docket; and the third table contains corrections of information included on the Docket.</p>
        <p id="p-41" data-page="62812">The facilities listed in each table are organized by state and then grouped alphabetically within each state by the Federal agency responsible for the facility. Under each state heading is listed the name and address of the facility, the Federal agency responsible for the facility, the statutory provision(s) under which the facility was reported to EPA, and a code.<sup>
        [2]
      </sup>
          The code key precedes the lists.</p>
        
        <p id="p-43" data-page="62812">The statutory provisions under which a facility is reported are listed in a column titled &#x201C;Reporting Mechanism.&#x201D; Applicable mechanisms are listed for each facility: for example, Sections 3005, 3010, 3016, 103(c), or Other. &#x201C;Other&#x201D; has been added as a reporting mechanism to indicate those Federal facilities that otherwise have been identified to have releases or threat of releases of hazardous substances. The National Contingency Plan 40 CFR 300.405 addresses discovery or notification, outlines what constitutes discovery of a hazardous substance release, and states that a release may be discovered in several ways, including: (1) A report submitted in accordance with Section 103(a) of CERCLA, i.e., reportable quantities codified at 40 CFR part 302; (2) a report submitted to EPA in accordance with Section 103(c) of CERCLA; (3) investigation by government authorities conducted in accordance with Section 104(e) of CERCLA or other statutory authority; (4) notification of a release by a Federal or state permit holder when required by its permit; (5) inventory or survey efforts or random or incidental observation reported by government agencies or the public; (6) submission of a citizen petition to EPA or the appropriate Federal facility requesting a preliminary assessment, in accordance with Section 105(d) of CERCLA; (7) a report submitted in accordance with Section 311(b)(5) of the CWA; and (8) other sources. As a policy matter, EPA generally believes it is appropriate for Federal facilities identified through the CERCLA discovery and notification process to be included on the Docket.</p>

        <p id="p-44" data-page="62812">The complete list of Federal facilities that now make up the Docket and the NPL and NFRAP status are available to interested parties and can be obtained at <i>http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/documents/docket.htm</i> by clicking on the link for <i>Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket Update #24</i> or by calling Tim Mott, the EPA HQ Docket Coordinator, at (703) 603-8807. As of today, the total number of Federal facilities that appear on the Docket is 2,358.</p>
