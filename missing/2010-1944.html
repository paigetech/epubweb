<br><p><b>Summary of Millennium Challenge Compact With the Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-4" data-page="4849">The five-year Millennium Challenge Compact with the Republic of Moldova (&#x201C;Compact&#x201D;) will provide up to $262 million to reduce poverty and accelerate economic growth. The Compact is intended to improve agricultural productivity and to expand access to markets and services through investments in critical infrastructure in the irrigation and road sectors, and through capacity-building in the high value agriculture sector (&#x201C;Program&#x201D;).</p>
        <br><p><b>Transition to High Value Agriculture Project ($101.77 Million)</b></p>

        <p id="p-5" data-page="4849">The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project (&#x201C;THVA Project&#x201D;) seeks to (i) increase rural incomes by stimulating growth in high value agriculture (&#x201C;HVA&#x201D;) and (ii) act as a catalyst for future investment in HVA production by establishing a successful model that contributes to a conducive institutional and policy environment for irrigated agriculture. Agriculture has been the backbone of the Moldovan economy, though, following the collapse
:::index 79p4850

of the Soviet Union, Moldova lost its position as a key exporter of fresh produce, and its extensive irrigation systems and post-harvest cold chain fell into disrepair. Today, the country&apos;s agricultural sector suffers from poor water service, production of low-value crops, low water-tariff revenue, and underinvestment in maintenance of the irrigation system, all of which contribute to high rates of rural poverty. However, with its fertile soils, relatively long growing season, and proximity to both European Union and former Soviet markets, Moldova has many of the necessary conditions to regain competitiveness in HVA. The THVA Project supports the government of Moldova&apos;s national strategy to increase land under irrigation and to upgrade the cold chain to facilitate the transition to HVA. The set of four reinforcing and integrated activities include:</p>
        <ul>
<li id="p-6" data-page="4850">
<i>Centralized Irrigation System Rehabilitation:</i> Rehabilitation of up to 11 large irrigation systems servicing an area of approximately 15,500 hectares located along the Prut and Nistru rivers that will provide reliable water needed for HVA crops, as well as improve food security through enhanced grain production.</li>
        <li id="p-7" data-page="4850">
<i>Irrigation Sector Reform:</i> Provision of technical assistance and capacity-building to: (i) Support the establishment of water user associations able to manage and operate the rehabilitated irrigation systems and the legal transfer of responsibilities for operations and maintenance of repaired irrigation systems to water user associations; (ii) improve water resource management by the government, including the establishment of a modem water-rights system; and (iii) ensure the legal and institutional framework needed for irrigation sector sustainability and further private and donor investment.</li>
        <li id="p-8" data-page="4850">
<i>Access to Agricultural Finance:</i> Establishment of financing facilities that will support HVA-related investment by farmers and rural entrepreneurs.</li>
        <li id="p-9" data-page="4850">
<i>Growing HVA Sales:</i> Provision of technical assistance to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to better access HVA markets and support the shift to HVA at the production and post-harvest level, in an activity undertaken jointly with, and administered by, the United States Agency for International Development.</li>
</ul>
        <br><p><b>Road Rehabilitation Project ($132.84 Million)</b></p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="4850">The Road Rehabilitation Project seeks to (i) increase the income of the local population through reduced cost of transport and reduced costs of goods and services; (ii) reduce losses to the national economy resulting from the deteriorated road conditions; and (iii) reduce the number of road accidents through improved traffic conditions. Specifically, the project will support the rehabilitation of the M2 road, which is part of an arterial highway connecting Chisinau, the Moldovan capital, to the Ukrainian border and beyond to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. This route serves as a significant link between Moldova and Ukraine for private, passenger, and commercial traffic, and has been prioritized by the government of Moldova in its National Development Strategy and Land Transport Infrastructure Strategy with the long-term goal to provide an efficient transport system that facilitates opportunities for trade in domestic and international markets and the mobility of its citizens. The existing M2 segment is a paved two-lane road that is extremely deteriorated. Compact funding will support the rehabilitation of 93 kilometers, beginning at the city of Sarateni at the southern end, passing near the city of Soroca, and ending at the junction with the R7 road west to Drochia at the northern end; construction (or reconstruction) or associated structures such as bridges and culverts; and improvement in road safety along the rehabilitated corridor. In addition, the Compact will fund a feasibility study, environmental and social impact assessment, detailed design work, and a resettlement action plan for the road segment continuing on to the Ukrainian border at the town of Otaci. These studies can be used by the government of Moldova to seek funding from other donors, or to plan investments with its own resources.</p>
        <br><p><b>Administration</b></p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="4850">The Compact also includes program management and oversight costs estimated at $23.85 million over a five-year time frame, including the costs of administration, management, auditing, fiscal and procurement agent services and environmental and social oversight. In addition, the cost of monitoring and evaluation of the Compact is budgeted at approximately $3.54 million.</p>
        <br><p><b>Intended Beneficiaries and Expected Results</b></p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="4850">The THVA Project is expected to benefit approximately 32,000 households (or approximately 124,000 individuals), with an average total benefit over 20 years equal to 170 percent of the beneficiaries&apos; current annual income. Beneficiaries include owners or shareholders of farming enterprises; farmers or owners of land; and laborers employed in the operation of enterprise farms within the command areas where MCC will rehabilitate the irrigation systems, as well as producers and intermediaries investing in and working in the HVA sector. The economic analyses indicate an economic rate of return of approximately 12.7 percent.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="4850">The Road Rehabilitation Project is expected to benefit approximately 78,000 households (or approximately 302,000 beneficiaries) over the next 20 years, with an economic rate of return of approximately 19 percent. Beneficiaries include users and owners of motorized vehicles utilizing the road including local agricultural and other producers and buyers, providers and users of passenger transport services, and noncommercial owners of private motorized transport.</p>

        <br><p><b>A. Program Overview</b></p>
        <br><p><b>1. Background and Consultative Process</b></p>
        <p id="p-194" data-page="4857">With a population of approximately 3.8 million inhabitants, Moldova was originally declared eligible for MCC Compact assistance in 2006. The Government mobilized a team of consultants to conduct an empirical analysis of the key constraints to growth. This constraints analysis served as the basis for two rounds of national consultations through regional town-hall meetings, as well as numerous meetings with smaller groups of stakeholders. Following these consultations, the Government submitted a Compact proposal in February 2008. In addition to the national consultations, project-specific consultations were conducted as part of the environmental and social impact assessment, both by the Government and by MCC-contracted entities. These public fora involved consultations with key stakeholders including: local government officials, regional and national staff from government agencies, civil society representatives, environmental and social non-governmental organizations, and interested local people to evaluate the proposed projects, to raise concerns, and to make recommendations on the design requirements to enhance benefits and reduce negative impacts from project implementation. These recommendations are to be incorporated into the detailed design to better address community needs. In addition, the Government and MCC worked with a consultative group of public and private sector representatives in the agricultural sector.</p>
        <p id="p-195" data-page="4857">Agriculture has been the backbone of the Moldovan economy, with Moldova formerly serving as an important exporter of high value agriculture to the rest of the Soviet Union. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moldova lost its position as a key exporter of fresh produce, and its extensive irrigation systems and post-harvest cold chain fell into disrepair.</p>
        <p id="p-196" data-page="4857">Reforms necessary to attract private and donor investment in agriculture have been slow. As a result, Moldovan agriculture suffers from low productivity, contributing to high rates of rural poverty. However, with its fertile soils, relatively long growing season, and proximity to both European Union and former Soviet markets, Moldova has many of the necessary conditions to regain competitiveness in high value agriculture. The key constraints facing Moldovan producers are: lack of reliable water, lack of financing, lack of access to markets and technologies and lack of know-how. The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project will address these constraints.</p>

        <p id="p-197" data-page="4857">The quality of the road network in Moldova is seriously deteriorated and has been cited repeatedly as a binding constraint to economic growth which impacts the entire country, as the country&apos;s economy is highly dependent on road transport. The Road Rehabilitation Project will address this constraint.

        </p>
        <br><p><b>2. Program Objective</b></p>
        <p id="p-198" data-page="4858">The Program Objective is to increase incomes through increased agricultural productivity and expanded access to markets and services through improved roads. The Program consists of the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project and the Road Rehabilitation Project as further described in this Annex I.</p>
        <br><p><b>3. Environmental and Social Safeguards</b></p>

        <p id="p-199" data-page="4858">The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project and the Road Rehabilitation Project will be implemented in compliance with the MCC Environmental Guidelines and MCC&apos;s environmental and social guidelines posted from time to time on the MCC Web site or otherwise made available to the Government by MCC (&#x201C;<i>MCC Gender Policy&#x201D;</i>) and any resettlement will be carried out in accordance with best international resettlement standards based on the World Bank&apos;s Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement in effect as of July 2007 (&#x201C;<i>OP 4.12&#x201D;</i>) and in accordance with procedures approved by MCC. The Government will also ensure that the Projects comply with all national environmental laws and regulations, licenses and permits, except to the extent such compliance would be inconsistent with this Compact. The Government will: (a) Cooperate with any ongoing environmental review, or if necessary undertake and complete any additional environmental reviews, required by MCC or under the laws of Moldova; (b) implement to MCC&apos;s satisfaction environmental and social mitigation measures identified in such environmental review; and (c) commit to fund environmental mitigation, (including costs of resettlement) in excess of MCC Funding not specifically provided for in the budget for any Project.</p>
        <p id="p-200" data-page="4858">To maximize the positive social impacts of the Projects, address cross-cutting social and gender issues such as human trafficking, child and forced labor, and HIV/AIDS, and ensure compliance with the MCC Gender Policy, MCA-Moldova will: (i) Develop a comprehensive social and gender integration plan which, at a minimum, identifies approaches for regular, meaningful and inclusive consultations with women and other vulnerable/underrepresented groups, consolidates the findings and recommendations of Project-specific social and gender analyses and sets forth strategies for incorporating findings of the social and gender analyses into final Project designs as appropriate; and (ii) ensure, through monitoring and coordination during implementation, that final Project Activity designs, construction tender documents and implementation plans are consistent with and incorporate the outcomes of the social and gender analysis and social and gender integration plan.</p>
        <br><p><b>B. Description of the Projects</b></p>

        <p id="p-201" data-page="4858">Set forth below is a description of each of the Projects that the Government will implement, or cause to be implemented, using MCC Funding to advance the applicable Project Objective. In addition, specific activities that will be undertaken within each Project (each, an &#x201C;<i>Activity&#x201D;</i>), including sub-activities, are described.</p>
        <br><p><b>1. Transition to High Value Agriculture Project</b></p>
        <p id="p-202" data-page="4858">(a) Summary of Project and Activities.</p>
        <p id="p-203" data-page="4858">The objectives of the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project are to: (i) Increase rural incomes by stimulating growth in irrigated high value agriculture; and (ii) catalyze future investments in high value agriculture by establishing a successful and sustainable model of irrigation system and water resource management and a conducive institutional and policy environment for irrigated agriculture.</p>

        <p id="p-204" data-page="4858">The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project consists of four reinforcing and integrated activities that, when implemented together, address the key constraints facing Moldovan producers: lack of reliable water, lack of financing, lack of access to markets and technologies, and lack of know-how (the &#x201C;<i>Transition to High Value Agriculture Project&#x201D;</i>). The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project will increase the ability and willingness of farmers to make the transition to higher value fruit and vegetable production. By addressing infrastructure and institutional/market constraints, the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project will break the vicious cycle of poor water service, low water tariff revenue, underinvestment in irrigation system maintenance, and low investment by farmers in high value agriculture (resulting in low agricultural incomes). The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project provides the first opportunity to pilot a set of institutional and management reforms, together with much needed infrastructure rehabilitation that will set the stage for future investment and enable Moldova to benefit from its natural comparative advantage in agriculture.</p>

        <p id="p-205" data-page="4858">The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project will: (i) Rehabilitate up to 11 irrigation systems covering a command area of up to approximately 15,500 hectares (the &#x201C;<i>Centralized Irrigation System Rehabilitation Activity&#x201D;</i>); (ii) provide technical assistance and capacity building to (1) support legal transfer of management and operations of MCC-rehabilitated systems from the Government to Water User Associations (&#x201C;<i>WUAs&#x201D;</i>), (2) improve water resource management, including establishment of a modern water rights system, and (3) ensure the legal and institutional framework needed for private and/or donor investment in the irrigation sector (the &#x201C;<i>Irrigation Sector Reform Activity&#x201D;</i>); (iii) provide term financing and technical assistance to support high value agriculture-related investments by farmers and rural entrepreneurs (the &#x201C;<i>Access to Agricultural Finance Activity&#x201D;</i>); and (iv) provide market development support and technical assistance and training to help producers and agribusinesses better access high value agriculture markets and support the shift to high value agriculture at the production and post-harvest level, and promote sustainable agricultural practices (the &#x201C;<i>Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity&#x201D;</i>), the latter to be undertaken jointly with, and administered by, the United States Agency for International Development (&#x201C;<i>USAID&#x201D;</i>).</p>
        <p id="p-206" data-page="4858">The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project consists of the following Activities:</p>
        <p id="p-207" data-page="4858">(i) Centralized Irrigation System Rehabilitation Activity.</p>
        <p id="p-208" data-page="4858">Most of the Government-owned irrigation infrastructure in Moldova requires rehabilitation to bring the systems back into working condition. MCC Funding will be used to rehabilitate up to 11 systems to provide reliable water to farm operations in their command areas. The 11 systems eligible for rehabilitation have completed feasibility studies and are listed below, along with their respective system numbers as listed in the Government proposal to MCC, as follows:</p>

repair and/or replacement of pumps, valves, piping and ancillary systems, water intakes, related electrical and control systems, and pump station buildings; rehabilitation of reservoirs; and, installation of new system components where needed.</p>
        <p id="p-222" data-page="4859">(2) <i>Non-construction activities:</i> These costs may include, without limitation, studies, construction supervision, WUA equipment reserve, environmental and social mitigation (including temporary or permanent resettlement compensation associated with construction) and other project management costs and technical assistance to be incurred in connection with the Centralized Irrigation System Rehabilitation Activity.</p>
        <p id="p-223" data-page="4859">(ii) Irrigation Sector Reform Activity.</p>
        <p id="p-224" data-page="4859">The Irrigation Sector Reform Activity is designed to: (1) Establish the enabling environment and institutional capacity required to ensure effective management (operations, maintenance and financing) of the rehabilitated irrigation systems (thereby better ensuring their sustainability); and (2) improve Moldova&apos;s capacity to manage its limited water resources in light of increasing demand for water and the expected effects of climate change.</p>

        <p id="p-225" data-page="4859">MCC and the Government agree that institutional and policy reforms surrounding the centralized irrigation sector are necessary to maximize sustainability and project impact. The Irrigation Sector Reform Activity will transfer management responsibility for irrigation systems rehabilitated using MCC Funding from the Government to users by establishing and building capacity within WUAs. As a necessary condition for success in transfer of management and operations and maintenance responsibilities to WUAs, a new WUA law acceptable to MCC (&#x201C;<i>WUA Law&#x201D;</i>) is required in Moldova to provide a solid legal foundation both for the transfer process and for the WUAs themselves to manage the systems. The Government will also ensure passage of a new water law acceptable to MCC (&#x201C;<i>Water Law&#x201D;</i>) that will provide more secure long-term water rights and the framework to issue water management authorizations and improved and upgraded systems for water resource management at the basin level.</p>

        <p id="p-226" data-page="4859">The Irrigation Sector Reform Activity consists of two sub-Activities: (1) The creation and implementation of improved institutional arrangements for the operations and maintenance of rehabilitated irrigation infrastructure (the &#x201C;<i>Irrigation Management Transfer Sub-Activity&#x201D;</i>); and (2) a comprehensive approach to water management to build the Government&apos;s capacity to ensure that water resources are effectively managed over the long term (the &#x201C;<i>River Basin Management Sub-Activity&#x201D;</i>).</p>
        <p id="p-227" data-page="4859">(1) Irrigation Management Transfer Sub-Activity.</p>

        <p id="p-228" data-page="4859">The main objectives of the Irrigation Management Transfer Sub-Activity are: (A) Establishment of fully-functional WUAs with the capacity to effectively manage and maintain the rehabilitated systems; and (B) legal transfer of management responsibilities from the Government to those WUAs through management transfer agreements (&#x201C;<i>MTAs&#x201D;</i>).</p>
        <p id="p-229" data-page="4859">MCC Funding will support technical assistance and training to: (A) Assist WUA formation in a manner consistent with the WUA Law and with best practices of financially and operationally sustainable water service entities; (B) build capacity within WUAs to exercise responsibility for operations and maintenance of the rehabilitated systems; (C) support creation of a legal environment that enables WUAs to exercise this responsibility (WUA Law, Water Law with long-term water rights, and binding MTAs in full compliance with Moldovan law); and (D) assist and support the Government, as the legal owner of the irrigation infrastructure, to negotiate and sign system specific MTAs that legally transfer irrigation management responsibilities to WUAs for all rehabilitated systems.</p>
        <p id="p-230" data-page="4859">(2) River Basin Management Sub-Activity.</p>
        <p id="p-231" data-page="4859">Water resource management is vital to the sustainability of both irrigated agriculture and Moldova&apos;s long-term non-agricultural development. Growing demand for water, and concerns about climate change and the increasing frequency of drought and floods require improved water resource planning and secure water rights. The purpose of this sub-Activity is to help the Government improve management of water resources and assess future water availability in order to promote sustainable growth in the agricultural sector. In particular, the sub-Activity will: (A) Support the implementation of a Water Law and development of secondary regulations institutionalizing a modern system of secure, long-term water rights and river basin management; (B) provide institutional support and equipment (geographical information systems, databases, and decision support tools) to the Government to improve its ability to monitor water quality and quantity and issue water certificates under a Water Law and river basin management system; and (C) build institutional capacity in the Government to engage stakeholders in the participatory planning and management of water resources through a system of basin and sub-basin councils and management plans.</p>
        <p id="p-232" data-page="4859">(iii) Access to Agricultural Finance Activity.</p>
        <p id="p-233" data-page="4859">The objective of the Access to Agricultural Finance Activity is to provide term financing needed to support increased investment in the high value agriculture supply chain to facilitate transition to high value agriculture, with particular focus on serving farmers and enterprises operating in the irrigation systems targeted for rehabilitation. Improved sorting and packing of produce, and the ability to extend the production and marketing season, can assist Moldovan producers to become more competitive in domestic and export markets and to sell their production at a higher price. However, with virtually no domestic sources of long-term funding and little ability to access international debt markets, Moldovan financial institutions largely lack the ability to lend for investments in the high value agriculture supply chain for periods longer than three years.</p>
        <p id="p-234" data-page="4859">The Access to Agricultural Finance Activity will be initiated on a pilot basis, which will be evaluated through an independent impact evaluation. The impact evaluation will likely involve some denial of credit under the Activity to otherwise eligible approved borrowers, possibly through randomization. The final decision whether to scale up or terminate the program will be in accordance to the PIA and will ensure that the activity, if scaled up, is likely to have an economic rate of return of 12 percent as determined by MCC&apos;s model for the Access to Agricultural Finance Activity in consultation with MCA-Moldova, or a rate acceptable to MCC, given the level of &#x201C;additionality&#x201D; of investment evidenced by the pilot, as well as other known parameters and costs of the activity at the time of this review.</p>

        <p id="p-235" data-page="4859">The Access to Agricultural Finance Activity consists of two sub-Activities: (1) Term financing to support increased investments in the high value agriculture value chain (the &#x201C;<i>High Value Agriculture Post-Harvest Credit Facility&#x201D;</i>); and (2) demand-driven investment development services support (the &#x201C;<i>Investment Development Services&#x201D;</i>).</p>
        <p id="p-236" data-page="4859">(1) High Value Agriculture Post-Harvest Credit Facility Sub-Activity.</p>

        <p id="p-237" data-page="4859">The objective of the High Value Agriculture Post-Harvest Credit Facility will provide term loans (three to seven years) through participating financial institutions (&#x201C;<i>PFIs</i>&#x201D;) to fund post-harvest
:::index 79p4860

supply chain investments. It will be managed by the Credit Line Directorate (the &#x201C;<i>CLD</i>&#x201D;), which is a program management unit within the Ministry of Finance established by the World Bank to oversee donor funded credit lines. Loans will be provided on a &#x201C;back-to-back&#x201D; basis (loans to PFIs will be made against, and will mirror terms of, PFI loans to end-borrowers). PFIs will take all repayment risk, with the obligation to repay loans regardless of the performance of the end-borrowers. PFIs will make their own underwriting decisions, subject to eligibility requirements stipulated by MCA-Moldova and MCC in the high value agriculture post- harvest policy and procedures manual. The primary benefit of the High Value Agriculture Post-Harvest Credit Facility is not to subsidize lending by financial institutions or investment by end borrowers, but instead to provide longer-term funding which is otherwise not available in the Moldovan financial markets. An approximate market-based rate will be established and adjusting on new and existing credits every six months, according to the process and methodology outlined in the high value agriculture post-harvest policy and procedures manual. The full list of eligible investments will be provided in the high value agriculture post-harvest policy and procedures manual. The specific determination of interest rates will be done in a manner consistent with a positive premium for the provision of term financing, and in a manner which prices loans not significantly below market rates. MCC reserves the right to review rates in context of changing market conditions, but will not raise the subsidy element as a means to increase disbursements without independent analysis showing that this would lead to greater additionality of viable investment. Borrowers are not restricted to investments in, adjacent to, or serving the MCC irrigation command areas.</p>
        <p id="p-238" data-page="4860">(2) Investment Development Services.</p>
        <p id="p-239" data-page="4860">Support for investment development services will be provided on a demand-driven cost sharing basis through Moldovan investment development service providers to those producers, producer groups and rural entrepreneurs interested in developing post harvest investment projects and obtaining loans for them via the High Value Agriculture Post-Harvest Credit Facility.</p>
        <p id="p-240" data-page="4860">(iv) Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity.</p>
        <p id="p-241" data-page="4860">The objective of the Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity is to increase farmer incomes by increasing sales of higher-value fruit and vegetables. Market assessments made during the project development process (and supported by the analysis of other donors) concluded that Moldova might have a comparative advantage in high value agriculture production. However, to realize this comparative advantage and compete on international markets, Moldovan high value agriculture producers and the Government will need to: (1) Aggressively seek export market opportunities; (2) upgrade production and the post harvest supply chain; (3) improve the enabling environment and create conditions conducive to high value agriculture (including reducing restrictions on new seed varieties and on imports of fertilizers and agriculture equipments); and (4) improve Moldova&apos;s compliance with sanitary and phytosanitary standards and ability to meet international standards.</p>
        <p id="p-242" data-page="4860">To simplify implementation and increase efficiency, MCC Funding will be used to expand a planned USAID-administered agricultural development project and to target Transition to High Value Agriculture Project beneficiaries, such as producers within the rehabilitated systems and other value chain actors active in the high value agriculture markets. Subject to funding availability, USAID intends to contribute funding and administer and implement the program on behalf of MCA-Moldova and MCC. Specifically, MCC Funding will support the following tasks under the joint MCA-Moldova and USAID Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity:</p>
        <p id="p-243" data-page="4860">(1) <i>Develop and Expand Market Opportunities for Moldovan High Value Agriculture Sub-Activity.</i> This sub-activity will focus on identifying market opportunities and understanding buyer requirements and specifications, with the objective of increasing export sales and attracting regional buyers and private sector investment to Moldova. As a part of the process of facilitating transactions and promoting Moldova as a source of high value agriculture in the region, several approaches for establishing a sustainable yet flexible network of buyers will be developed and tested.</p>
        <p id="p-244" data-page="4860">(2) <i>Training to Upgrade Production and Meet Buyer Requirements Sub-Activity.</i> This sub-activity will develop a field and classroom-based program to help value chain actors, with primary focus on producers and producer groups; better understand and meet buyer requirements; reduce production and marketing costs; capture price premiums; and increase sales through improved high value agriculture production, post-harvest, and marketing practices. Training will include assistance to farmers to promote sustainable agricultural practices, specifically pest management, and soil and water conservation. Moldovan agriculture service providers, supplemented with international sector specialists as required, will implement a no-fee training program targeting beneficiaries both inside and outside the rehabilitated systems.</p>
        <p id="p-245" data-page="4860">(3) <i>Demand-Driven Technical Assistance to Upgrade the High Value Agriculture Value Chain Sub-Activity.</i> This sub-activity is designed to support increased investment and improved performance in the high value agriculture value chain, with particular focus on the post-harvest infrastructure and equipment required to transition farmers to increased production of high value agriculture and enable producers, wholesalers and exporters to remain competitive and deliver fresh produce (properly packaged, stored and transported) to increasingly quality conscious buyers in the European Union, Commonwealth of Independent States, and domestic retail markets. A pre-approved group of local and international service providers will be established to provide customized consulting and business development services on a competitive, cost-sharing basis.</p>
        <p id="p-246" data-page="4860">(4) <i>Implement Recommendations for an Improved Enabling Environment Sub-Activity.</i> This sub-activity will augment on-going efforts by USAID and other donors to identify and implement needed policy reforms in the agriculture sector which will improve competiveness and increase or preserve access to export markets. This task will: (A) Provide technical assistance to help the Government adopt legislation and policies to implement reforms that support high value agriculture, with specific attention to improving access to (and reducing import tariffs on) quality seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs, including high value agriculture-related equipment; and (B) establish sanitary and phytosanitary standards systems and procedures to support exports and reduce the risks of export bans through narrowly targeted upgrades in Government sanitary and phytosanitary controls, including laboratory equipment. As part of this component, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry will be required to provide refurbished laboratory space, in conditions acceptable to USAID.</p>
        <p id="p-247" data-page="4860">(b) Beneficiaries.</p>

        <p id="p-248" data-page="4860">By 2029, the Parties expect that the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project will have benefitted at least
:::index 79p4861

124,000 individuals, or at least 31,000 households. Beneficiaries of the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project include households with owners or shareholders of farming enterprises, farmers or owners of land, producers and intermediaries investing in and working in the high agriculture value sector, and laborers employed in the operation of enterprise farms within the command areas where MCC will rehabilitate the irrigation systems and producers and agribusinesses outside the systems targeted for rehabilitation that are already engaged in the high value agriculture sector.</p>
        <p id="p-249" data-page="4861">Farm enterprises in the centralized irrigation system areas are expected to capture the majority of the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project&apos;s benefits. Up to 3,100 farm households are expected to benefit from the rehabilitation of centralized irrigation systems. Switching from non-irrigated to irrigated agriculture in Moldova can increase profitability by 200-500 percent or higher on a per hectare basis, depending on the crop mix. In the next 20 years, poor households could realize a cumulative increase in income equivalent to three years of current farm earnings, even with assumptions of gradual and partial adoption of irrigation. Individuals employed in seasonal labor will also benefit from the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project. Demand for seasonal labor is projected to increase as farms switch from grains to more labor-intensive high value agriculture crops. A projected 9,300 employees, most of whom are poor, will realize increased wage income due to greater demand for agricultural labor in the centralized irrigation system areas. Landowners will also benefit from the increased productivity and value of their land once it has access to irrigation. It is projected that approximately 15,500 individuals renting out their agricultural land will realize increased rent income of at least 20 percent.</p>
        <p id="p-250" data-page="4861">The Access to Agricultural Finance Activity will directly benefit more than 100 post-production investors. The Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity, which is intended to use USAID funds, subject to availability, and MCC Funding, will assist individuals in the centralized irrigation system areas, as well as an additional 2,000 high value agriculture producers outside the centralized irrigation system areas, of whom at least 1,300 producers are expected to realize income gains. Additionally, the policy improvement and efforts to improve sanitary and phytosanitary standards of the Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity is expected to increase and safeguard incomes for all high value agriculture producers in Moldova, estimated at 83,000 households and 315,000 beneficiaries as of 2009.</p>
        <p id="p-251" data-page="4861">(c) Environmental and Social Mitigation.</p>
        <p id="p-252" data-page="4861">The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project is classified as &#x201C;Category A&#x201D; according to MCC Environmental Guidelines because it could potentially result in significant, long-term direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental and social impacts, including impacts to two international waterways. Environmental and social impact assessments have been initiated, which will inform detailed project design and establish environmental management plans and resettlement policy framework or action plans to be implemented during the construction and operation phases of the project</p>
        <p id="p-253" data-page="4861">The Access to Agricultural Finance Activity will be designed and implemented in accordance with requirements set forth in MCC Environmental Guidelines for &#x201C;Category D&#x201D; (financial intermediary) projects, requiring pre-screening of loan applications for environmental and social impacts as part of the approval process. MCC Environmental Guidelines under Category D reserves for MCC the &#x201C;right to set additional performance standards and monitoring requirements for subprojects on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the intermediate facility.&#x201D;</p>
        <p id="p-254" data-page="4861">(d) Donor Coordination.</p>
        <p id="p-255" data-page="4861">MCC has coordinated closely with the two donors most active in the agriculture sector in Moldova&#x2014;USAID and the World Bank&#x2014;on the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project. MCC has also worked closely with the European Union, World Bank, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations Development Fund for Women on environmental and social issues such as water resource management and gender. Further, the World Bank Mission in Chisinau, Moldova, and World Bank sector and regional specialists in Washington, DC, have provided contacts, studies, lessons learned, and informal peer review at all stages in the process starting with early concerns about land tenure and consolidation issues. Input and collaboration between the World Bank and MCC have been the most significant and influential in the development of the access to agricultural finance, irrigation management transfer, and food safety components and interventions.</p>
        <p id="p-256" data-page="4861">Also significant is the successful partnership between USAID, MCC and MCA-Moldova. USAID and MCC worked together to develop a joint project designed to build on USAID&apos;s 15 years of experience in the agriculture sector and, at the same time, support the significant MCC irrigation infrastructure investment. Subject to the availability of funds, the joint Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity is intended to provide the technical assistance and market development support needed to help producers transition to high value agriculture fruit and vegetable crops. The Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity, which will target, but will not be limited to, areas where MCC irrigation rehabilitation will occur, is designed to emphasize promotion of market opportunities within Moldova and encourage increased private sector and foreign investment in the high value agriculture sector. Subject to the availability of funds, USAID intends to contribute funding for the Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity, which would be administered by USAID on behalf of MCA-Moldova. This joint approach addresses and reduces implementation capacity concerns by allowing for improved implementation and project oversight and more efficient use of resources.</p>
        <p id="p-257" data-page="4861">(e) Sustainability.</p>
        <p id="p-258" data-page="4861">The Transition to High Value Agriculture Project is designed as a comprehensive project that will increase farmer incomes and break the cycle of poor water service, low water tariff revenue, underinvestment in irrigation system maintenance, and low investment by farmers in high value agriculture. Each of the four activities reinforces the other in ensuring project sustainability and building the capacity of local institutions and service providers.</p>

        <p id="p-259" data-page="4861">The Irrigation Sector Reform Activity, and its Irrigation Management Transfer Sub-Activity and River Basin Management Sub-Activity, are designed to ensure that the rehabilitated centralized irrigation systems (MCC&apos;s primary high value agriculture investment) are effectively operated and maintained through the transfer of responsibility for operations and maintenance to the WUAs. A condition for commencing rehabilitation of these systems is the passage of a WUA Law that will support the legal transfer of responsibility for Government owned assets to WUAs. The WUA Law will require that WUA membership represents at least 50 percent of the users and 50 percent of the intended service area of the WUA. The WUA Law will also empower the WUAs with the
:::index 79p4862

authority to establish and collect water tariffs sufficient to cover their fixed costs and ensure financial stability of the rehabilitated systems. The River Basin Management Sub-Activity will provide a comprehensive approach to water management to build the Government&apos;s capacity to ensure that water resources are effectively managed over the long term.</p>
        <p id="p-260" data-page="4862">The Access to Agricultural Finance Activity and Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity address the need to upgrade production and the high value agriculture value chain in order for Moldovan high value agriculture producers to become and remain competitive in the long term. It will also promote water and soil conservation, integrated pest management, and other sustainable agricultural practices. Both of these activities are driven by market signals and demand from the value chain actors, ensuring that the most appropriate and targeted training and technical assistance is provided. Technical assistance programs in both activities will utilize local service providers whenever possible, and will provide training to those local service providers so that they are able to sustainably serve the market after the Compact is completed. The High Value Agriculture Post-Harvest Credit Facility is intended to extend beyond the end of the Compact to facilitate issuance of loans extending beyond the Compact.</p>
        <p id="p-261" data-page="4862">(f) Policy, Legal and Regulatory Reforms.</p>
        <p id="p-262" data-page="4862">Regulatory reform is required for the success of the Transition to High Value Agriculture Project. The publication in the &#x201C;Monitorul Oficial&#x201D; of the WUA Law acceptable to MCC, which law will be in full force and effect no later than three months after the date of publication, is a condition precedent to signing the detailed design studies contract for the centralized irrigation system rehabilitation. Registration of WUAs to operate and maintain the centralized irrigation systems to be rehabilitated, and publication in the &#x201C;Monitorul Oficial&#x201D; of the Water Law acceptable to MCC are conditions precedent to commencement of procurement for the centralized irrigation system construction works contract.</p>
        <br><p><b>2. Road Rehabilitation Project</b></p>
        <p id="p-263" data-page="4862">(a) Summary of Project and Activities.</p>
        <p id="p-264" data-page="4862">The objectives of the Road Rehabilitation Project (the &#x201C;<i>Road Rehabilitation Project&#x201D;</i>) are to: (i) Increase incomes of the local population by reducing the cost of transport, goods and services; (ii) reduce losses to the national economy resulting from the deteriorated road conditions; and (iii) reduce the number of road accidents through improved traffic conditions. Rooted in the National Development Strategy and the Land Transport Infrastructure Strategy (2008-2017), the Road Rehabilitation Project was developed with the assistance of external partners in the road sector (World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, European Commission, and MCC, collectively the &#x201C;<i>Joint Group&#x201D;</i>). The strategy recommends the rehabilitation of the major trans-national axis that crosses Moldova from north to south.</p>
        <p id="p-265" data-page="4862">The Road Rehabilitation Project will improve part of the M2<sup>
        [1]
      </sup>
          road (&#x201C;<i>M2</i>&#x201D;), which is an arterial highway from the Moldovan capital, Chisinau, through the city of Soroca, to the Ukrainian border and beyond to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. This route contains significant traffic flows, serves as a significant link between Moldova and Ukraine for private, passenger, and commercial traffic, and has been prioritized by the Government for rehabilitation.</p>
        
        <p id="p-267" data-page="4862">The Road Rehabilitation Project consists of the following:</p>
        <p id="p-268" data-page="4862">(i) M2 Road Activity.</p>

        <p id="p-269" data-page="4862">MCC Funding will be used to rehabilitate and upgrade a 93 km portion of the M2, beginning near Sarateni at the southern end and ending at the junction with the R7 road west to Drochia (the &#x201C;Drochia junction&#x201D;) at the northern end (the &#x201C;<i>M2 Road Activity</i>&#x201D;). MCC Funding will also be used to replace or upgrade associated structures within this segment of the M2, such as bridges, drainage systems and culverts, to improve road maintenance and safety. The M2&apos;s improvement is expected to reduce vehicle operating costs, reduce travel time, change maintenance costs, cause an increase in the value of goods moved and cause an increase in frequent travel. Specifically, MCC Funding will support:</p>
        <p id="p-270" data-page="4862">(1) <i>Construction costs:</i> These costs include, without limitation, pavement rehabilitation and strengthening, embankment construction, road safety improvements, replacement or upgrading of associated structures, such as bridges, drainage systems and culverts, and any activity associated with the environmental management plan developed with respect to the Activity.</p>
        <p id="p-271" data-page="4862">(2) <i>Non-construction costs:</i> These costs include, without limitation, studies, construction supervision, environmental and social mitigation (including resettlement), and other project management costs and technical assistance to be incurred in connection with the M2 Road Activity.</p>
        <p id="p-272" data-page="4862">(ii) Supplemental Feasibility Study/ESIA and Design.</p>
        <p id="p-273" data-page="4862">MCC Funding will also be used for a feasibility study/environmental and social impact assessment for the road segment from Arionesti to the border crossing in Otaci, detailed design work, a resettlement action plan and an updated environmental and social impact assessment for the entire road section from the Drochia junction to the border crossing in Otaci.</p>
        <p id="p-274" data-page="4862">(b) Beneficiaries.</p>

        <p id="p-275" data-page="4862">The M2 Road Activity is expected to benefit approximately 78,000 households over the next 20 years, or approximately 302,000 beneficiaries. Rehabilitation of the M2 will benefit the users and owners of motorized vehicles utilizing the road, including local agricultural and other producers and buyers; providers and users of passenger transport services; and non-commercial owners of private motorized transport. In addition, sellers and merchandisers of products transported along this road will likely benefit. At present there are approximately 273,000 beneficiaries living along the road, and approximately 29,000 individuals from the road rehabilitation outside the region. Over 20 years, poor beneficiary households (earning less than US$2 purchasing power parity (&#x201C;<i>PPP</i>&#x201D;) per day per capita) could realize a cumulative increase in income equivalent to more than one year of current income. Taking into account traffic originating from and destined for areas outside the adjacent areas, the beneficiary analysis estimates that about 15 percent of the beneficiaries of the investment will be among households that now live on less than US$2 per person per day (in PPP terms).</p>
        <p id="p-276" data-page="4862">(c) Environmental and Social Mitigation.</p>
        <p id="p-277" data-page="4862">The M2 Road Activity is classified as &#x201C;Category B&#x201D; according to MCC Environmental Guidelines. The M2 Road Activity is expected to produce site-specific and limited environmental and social impacts that can be mitigated and monitored. An environmental and social impact assessment has been initiated which will inform detailed product design and establish an environmental management plan and resettlement policy framework and action plans for construction.</p>
        <p id="p-278" data-page="4862">(d) Donor Coordination.</p>

        <p id="p-279" data-page="4862">In addition to general coordination with the Joint Group, the Road Rehabilitation Project will benefit from
:::index 79p4863

technical assistance being provided to the State Road Administration through the Road Sector Support Program funded by an approximate US$5 million World Bank credit. The program will fund consulting services for design and introduction of an axle load control system; consulting services for reform of road maintenance execution arrangements (including road asset valuation); technical and financial audits; support by local consultants in the areas of procurement, environment, and financial management; and training activities.</p>
        <p id="p-280" data-page="4863">(e) Sustainability.</p>
        <p id="p-281" data-page="4863">Sustainability of the Road Rehabilitation Project requires both routine and periodic maintenance, which can only be accomplished if there is adequate funding and if appropriate mechanisms are in place to carry out the maintenance. A lack of maintenance is evidenced by the state of deterioration of the road. At least 50 percent of the road needs to be reconstructed from the sub-base. Most of the bridges show severe corrosion of the reinforcement bars, causing a loss of required strength and concrete spalling.</p>
        <p id="p-282" data-page="4863">The Government, with the assistance of the Joint Group, had adopted the Land Transport Infrastructure Strategy, which, along with other points, addresses the current deficiencies in road maintenance funding and execution. In particular, the Government committed in writing in February 2008 to amend the Road Fund Law to ensure that an adequate percentage of the revenue from the fuel excise tax, sources of revenue introduced in large part to fund road maintenance, would be automatically allocated to the Road Fund.</p>
        <p id="p-283" data-page="4863">To increase the likelihood of sustaining the benefits of the rehabilitated M2, and to prepare a more sustainable basis for future investments in the roads sector, the Government will provide MCC with evidence that an amended Road Fund Law, providing a more reliable mechanism for adequate road maintenance funding, is in full force and effect, before invitations for construction bids are issued under the Compact. Measurable progress monitors are set forth in the Program Implementation Agreement as conditions precedent to disbursement for the Road Rehabilitation Project.</p>
        <p id="p-284" data-page="4863">(f) Policy, Legal and Regulatory Reforms.</p>
        <p id="p-285" data-page="4863">Policy, legal, and regulatory reforms are required to implement the Road Rehabilitation Project. As a condition precedent to commencement of procurement for construction, the Government will ensure the amendment of the Road Fund Law to provide sustainable funding for adequate road maintenance.</p>

Subject to Section 3.2(b) of the Compact, MCA-Moldova is responsible for implementation of the M&amp;E Plan. MCA-Moldova will oversee all Compact-related monitoring and evaluation activities conducted for each of the Projects, ensuring that data from all implementing entities is consistent, accurately reported and aggregated into regular Compact performance reports as described in the M&amp;E Plan.</p>
        <br><p><b>4. Evaluation Component</b></p>

        <p id="p-339" data-page="4869">The evaluation component of the M&amp;E Plan will contain three types of evaluations: (a) Impact evaluations; (b) project performance evaluations; and (c) special studies. The evaluation component of the M&amp;E Plan will describe the purpose of the evaluation, methodology, timeline, required MCC approvals, and the process for collection and analysis of data for each evaluation. The results of all evaluations will be made publicly available in accordance with MCC&apos;s guidelines for monitoring and evaluation plans posted from time to time on the MCC Web site (the &#x201C;<i>MCC Policy for Monitoring and Evaluation of Compacts and Threshold Programs&#x201D;</i>).</p>
        <p id="p-340" data-page="4869">(a) <i>Impact Evaluation.</i> The M&amp;E Plan will include a description of the methods to be used for impact evaluations and plans for integrating the evaluation method into Project design. Based on in-country consultation with stakeholders, the strategies outlined below were jointly determined as having the strongest potential for rigorous impact evaluation. The M&amp;E Plan will further outline in detail these methodologies. Final impact evaluation strategies are to be included in the M&amp;E Plan. The following is a summary of the potential impact evaluation methodologies:</p>
        <p id="p-341" data-page="4869">(i) Transition to High Value Agriculture Project.</p>
        <p id="p-342" data-page="4869">(1) The Centralized Irrigation System Rehabilitation Activity and Irrigation Management Transfer Sub-Activity will be examined in conjunction with the MCC sponsored impact evaluation in order to measure the combined effect of improved access to water and the technical assistance offered under the Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity as well as the stand alone value of the irrigation rehabilitation. Over time, hectares irrigated, hectares producing high value agriculture crops, and farm profits in areas where the Centralized Irrigation System Rehabilitation Activity and Irrigation Management Transfer Activity are implemented should increase dramatically compared to areas outside the project area, and the path of causation would be clear, therefore methodologies employing randomization of access to the Centralized Irrigation System Rehabilitation Activity and Irrigation Management Transfer Activity will not be a necessary element of the evaluation. This strategy is contingent on timely execution of the Centralized Irrigation System Rehabilitation Activity that would allow at least one growing season after improved irrigation to be observed.</p>
        <p id="p-343" data-page="4869">(2) For the Access to Agricultural Finance Activity, the incremental impact that can be attributed to MCC&apos;s investments will be estimated by comparing outcomes such as total investment and profitability between those who received loans through the program and a comparison group. A suitable method for creating a comparison group is expected to include an element of randomized credit provision. Challenges such as the availability of other donor financing and the potentially limited scope of post-harvest investment in Moldova may dictate amendments to this strategy during the evaluation design phase. Since gaps exist in many countries&apos; financial markets where banks rely on a high level of collateral and equity markets are under-developed, it would be of value for Moldova, MCC, and the donor community to understand the benefits and costs of subsidized lending. A mid-term review will be part of the evaluation plan, and the activity may be terminated or scaled up depending upon the results of this mid-term evaluation.</p>
        <p id="p-344" data-page="4869">(3) For the Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity, the evaluation is expected to determine how the Activity trainings affect prices, profit margins, and yields. As it is intended that the Growing High Value Agriculture Sales Activity of the Compact would be implemented by USAID, close coordination in the evaluation would be required. MCC and USAID are currently in the process of defining how this coordination would occur and confirming the feasibility of such coordination. Randomized selection criteria are expected to be an element of the evaluation.</p>
        <p id="p-345" data-page="4869">(ii) Road Rehabilitation Project.</p>
        <p id="p-346" data-page="4869">A rigorous evaluation of the impact of the Road Rehabilitation Project is not envisioned due to the lengthy time of construction and the natural time required for the economy to adapt to the improvement.</p>
        <p id="p-347" data-page="4869">(b) <i>Final Evaluation.</i> The M&amp;E Plan will make provision for final Project level evaluations (&#x201C;<i>Final Evaluations&#x201D;</i>). With the prior written approval of MCC, MCA-Moldova will engage independent
:::index 79p4870

evaluators to conduct the Final Evaluations at the end of each Project. The Final Evaluations will review progress during Compact implementation and provide a qualitative context for interpreting monitoring data and impact evaluation findings. They must at a minimum (i) evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the Project Activities, (ii) determine if and analyze the reasons why the Compact Goal, Program Objective and Project Objective(s), outcome(s) and output(s) were or were not achieved, (iii) identify positive and negative unintended results of the Program, (iv) provide lessons learned that may be applied to similar projects, and (v) assess the likelihood that results will be sustained over time.</p>
        <p id="p-348" data-page="4870">(i) <i>Special Studies.</i> The M&amp;E Plan will include a description of the methods to be used for special studies, as necessary, funded through this Compact or by MCC. Plans for conducting the special studies will be determined jointly between MCA-Moldova and MCC before the approval of the M&amp;E Plan. The M&amp;E Plan will identify and make provision for any other special studies, ad hoc evaluations, and research that may be needed as part of the monitoring and evaluating of this Compact. Either MCC or MCA-Moldova may request special studies or ad hoc evaluations of Projects, Project Activities, or the Program as a whole prior to the expiration of the Compact Term. When MCA-Moldova engages an evaluator, the engagement will be subject to the prior written approval of MCC. Contract terms must ensure non-biased results and the publication of results.</p>
        <p id="p-349" data-page="4870">(c) <i>Request for Ad Hoc Evaluation or Special Study.</i> If MCA-Moldova requires an ad hoc independent evaluation or special study at the request of the Government for any reason, including for the purpose of contesting an MCC determination with respect to a Project or Activity or to seek funding from other donors, no MCC Funding or MCA-Moldova resources may be applied to such evaluation or special study without MCC&apos;s prior written approval.</p>
