        <p id="p-5" data-page="62849">The SHOP program provides grants to national and regional nonprofit organizations and consortia that have experience in providing self-help housing. Grant funds are used to purchase land and install or improve infrastructure, which together may not exceed an average investment of $15,000 per dwelling unit. Low-income homebuyers contribute a minimum of 100 hours of sweat equity on the construction of their homes and/or the homes of other homebuyers participating in the local self-help housing program. Sweat equity can include, but is not limited to, assisting in the painting, carpentry, trim work, drywall, roofing and siding for the housing. Persons with disabilities can substitute administrative tasks. Donated volunteer labor is also required.</p>

        <p id="p-6" data-page="62849">The SHOP funds together with the sweat equity and volunteer labor contributions significantly reduce the cost of the housing for the low-income homebuyers. The FY 2009 awards announced in this Notice were selected for funding in the competition posted on HUD&apos;s Web site on <i>http://www.hud.gov/offices/adm/grants/nofa09/gensec.pdf.</i> Applications were scored and selected for funding based on the selection criteria in the General Section and the SHOP program section which can be found at <i>http://www.hud.gov/library/bookshelf12/supernofa/nofa09/grpshop.cfm.</i>
        </p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="62849">The amount appropriated in FY 2009 to fund the SHOP grants was $26,500,000. The allocations for SHOP grantees are as follows:</p>
