</b></p>


        <p id="p-6" data-page="62919">Notice is hereby given that the FHWA, has taken final agency actions subject to 23 U.S.C. 139(<i>l</i>)(1) by issuing approvals for the following highway project in the State of Vermont: the Southern Connector/Champlain Parkway, Federal-aid Project Number MEGC-M5000(1), in the City of Burlington, Chittenden County. The project will consist of approximately 2.3 miles of a two-lane roadway with turning lanes on both new location and existing roadways. The project will begin at the western terminus of I-189 at Shelburne Street (U.S. Route 7) and will extend westerly and then northerly to the City Center District (CCD) at the intersection of Pine Street and Main Street. The general purposes of the project are to improve access from the vicinity of the interchange of I-189 and U.S. Route 7 to the Burlington CCD and the downtown waterfront area; and to improve circulation, reduce congestion, and improve safety on the local roadways in the project study area. The project includes a section of previously constructed roadway that has never been opened to traffic, new alignment from the end of the previously constructed section to Lakeside Avenue, and existing roadway along Lakeside Avenue and Pine Street. The actions by the Federal agencies, and the laws under which such actions were taken, are described in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) for the project, approved on September 22, 2009, in the FHWA Record of Decision (ROD) issued on January 13, 2010, and in other documents in the FHWA project files. The FSEIS, ROD, and other project records are available by contacting the FHWA or the Vermont Agency of Transportation at the addresses provided above. The FHWA FSEIS and ROD can also be viewed and downloaded from the project Web site at <i>http://www.aot.state.vt.us/progdev/Sections/LTF/SouthernConnectorSEIS/SouthernConnectorFSEIS.htm.</i>
