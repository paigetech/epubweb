<br><p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="62911">On August 4, 2010, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#x201C;FINRA&#x201D;) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#x201C;SEC&#x201D; or &#x201C;Commission&#x201D;), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#x201C;Act&#x201D;)<sup>
        [1]
      </sup>
          and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,<sup>
        [2]
      </sup>

          a proposed rule change that provides that a member, when notified by FINRA, may not continue to custody or retain record ownership of assets, at a non-member financial institution, which, upon FINRA staff&apos;s request, fails promptly to provide FINRA with written verification of assets maintained by the member at such financial institutions. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the

customer assets, at a financial institution that is not a member of FINRA, which, upon FINRA staff&apos;s request, fails promptly to provide FINRA with written verification of assets maintained by the member at such financial institution.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="62912">
          <i>(b) The Rule shall not apply:</i>
        </p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="62912">
          <i>(1) to proprietary assets of members that are treated as non-allowable assets under SEA Rule 15c3-1; or</i>
        </p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="62912">
          <i>(2) in instances where FINRA determines that there is no independent custody or record ownership of the assets.</i>

<br><p><b>III. Summary of Comment Letters and FINRA&apos;s Response 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-17" data-page="62912">The Commission received one comment to the proposed rule change.<sup>
        [6]
      </sup>
          The commenter opposed the proposal and asserted that the harm outweighed any benefit of the proposed rule. Specifically, the commenter indicated that certain assets are hard to verify and that the proposed rule failed to differentiate among different types of assets.<sup>
        [7]
      </sup>
          The commenter suggested, among other things, that FINRA not apply the rule to proprietary assets that are not allowable for net capital purposes. The commenter further raised concerns that the proposed rule would create an unwarranted burden on members, because it fails to address instances where a particular asset cannot be relocated from its country of origin or readily moved to another financial institution.<sup>
        [8]
      </sup>
          Additionally, the commenter asserted that the rule &#x201C;indirectly extends the extraterritorial application of the U.S. securities laws,&#x201D; and that compliance with the rule may violate foreign law. Finally, the commenter believed that instead of adopting the proposed rule, FINRA should look at other asset verification options and suggested the alternatives of conducting a study regarding the necessity of the proposed rule or establishing a separate bureau that would verify customers&apos; statements against the books and records of their broker-dealers.<sup>
        [9]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        
        
        
        <p id="p-22" data-page="62912">FINRA filed Amendment No. 1 and responded to the comments. Amendment No. 1 specifically addresses the commenter&apos;s suggestion that the rule should not apply to proprietary assets of members that are not allowable for net capital purposes. Accordingly, FINRA is proposing new paragraph (b)(1) of the rule, which would expressly exclude from the rule proprietary assets of members that are treated as non-allowable assets pursuant to Rule 15c3-1 of the Act. Moreover, in response to the commenter&apos;s concerns regarding the application of the proposed rule to assets that cannot be relocated to another financial institution, such as many limited partnership or hedge fund investments, FINRA is proposing new paragraph (b)(2) of the rule, which provides that the rule would not apply in instances where FINRA determines that there is no independent custody or record ownership of the assets.</p>
        
<br><p><b>IV. Discussion and Commission Findings 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-23" data-page="62912">After carefully considering the proposal, as modified by Amendment No. 1, the comments, and FINRA&apos;s response, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder that are applicable to a national securities association.<sup>
        [10]
      </sup>
          In particular, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<sup>
        [11]
      </sup>
          which requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. The proposed rule change is consistent with FINRA&apos;s statutory obligations under the Act to protect investors and the public interest because it would enhance FINRA&apos;s ability to verify assets at a financial institution which is not a member of FINRA.</p>
        
        
        <p id="p-26" data-page="62912">The Commission believes that FINRA adequately addressed the concerns raised by the commenter. The rule language in Amendment No. 1 specifically excludes proprietary assets that are not allowable for net capital purposes. It also adequately addresses the commenter&apos;s concerns regarding the application of the proposed rule to assets that cannot be relocated to another financial institution, by adding paragraph (b)(2) of the rule clarifies that the rule would not apply in instances where FINRA determines that there is no other independent custody or record ownership of the assets. The Commission believes the proposed rule, as modified by Amendment No. 1, further strengthens FINRA&apos;s ability to effectively detect fraud and protect investors.</p>
        
<br><p><b>V. Accelerated Approval 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-27" data-page="62912">The Commission finds good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act<sup>
        [12]
      </sup>

</b></p>

        <p id="p-35" data-page="62913">
          <i>It is therefore ordered,</i> pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,<sup>
        [13]
      </sup>
          that the proposed rule change (SR-FINRA-2010-042), as modified by Amendment No. 1, be, and hereby is, approved on an accelerated basis.</p>
