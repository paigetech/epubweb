        <br><p><b>(i) Rebates for Removing Liquidity</b></p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="39320">For securities priced $1.00 and over, the Exchange is proposing to rebate $0.0002 per share for executions that remove liquidity from the Exchange. For securities priced less than $1.00, there is no rebate/charge to remove liquidity. However, the removal rate on EDGA is proposed to be contingent on the attributed MPID adding (including Non-Displayed Orders<sup>
        [6]
      </sup>
          ) and/or routing a minimum average daily share volume, measured monthly, of 50,000 shares on EDGA. Any attributed MPID not meeting the aforementioned minimum is proposed to be charged: (i) $0.0030 per share for removing liquidity from EDGA; and (ii) 0.20% of dollar value for stocks priced less than $1.00.</p>
        
        <p id="p-14" data-page="39320">For the month of July 2010 only, the 50,000 average daily volume threshold will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the daily consolidated volumes for each Exchange-traded symbol for all days that such symbol is traded on the Exchange during the month of July and the denominator of which shall be the monthly consolidated volume for all Exchange-traded symbols during the month of July. This calculation adjusts this volume threshold during the month of July when trading is being phased into the Exchange from Direct Edge&apos;s ECN and reflects the portion of the volume that occurs on the Exchange during the month.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="39320">Upon a Member&apos;s request, the Exchange will aggregate share volume calculations for wholly owned affiliates on a prospective basis.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="39320">The rebates for removing liquidity will apply to securities traded on the Exchange pursuant to unlisted trading privileges that are listed on: (A) the New York Stock Exchange (&#x201C;NYSE&#x201D;); (B) regional exchanges, such as NYSE Arca Equities (&#x201C;NYSE Arca&#x201D;) and NYSE Alternext US (&#x201C;NYSE Alternext,&#x201D; formerly the American Stock Exchange); and (C) the NASDAQ Stock Market (&#x201C;Nasdaq&#x201D;) (&#x201C;Tape A Securities&#x201D;, &#x201C;Tape B Securities&#x201D; and &#x201C;Tape C Securities&#x201D;, respectively, and collectively, &#x201C;All Tapes&#x201D;).</p>
        <br><p><b>Applicable Flags 
:::index 75p39321

to Nasdaq using the INET order type and that remove liquidity in Tape A &amp; C Securities, a charge of $0.0030 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;L&#x201D;). The INET order type sweeps the EDGA book and removes liquidity from Nasdaq, if the order is marketable, or posts on Nasdaq, if the order is non-marketable. Members routing an average daily volume (&#x201C;ADV&#x201D;): (i) Less than 5,000,000 shares will be charged $0.0030 per share, as described above; (ii) equal to or greater than 5,000,000 shares but less than 20,000,000 shares will be charged Nasdaq&apos;s best removal tier rate per share; (iii) equal to or greater than 20,000,000 shares but less than 30,000,001 shares will be charged Nasdaq&apos;s best removal tier rate&#x2014;$0.0001 per share; and (iv) equal to or greater than 30,000,001 shares will be charged Nasdaq&apos;s best removal tier rate&#x2014;$0.0002 per share. The rates, in all cases, are calculated for shares removed from Nasdaq. The Exchange believes that this fee structure is equitable in that it applies uniformly to all Members and provides higher rebates for higher volume thresholds, resulting from lower administrative costs. Destination-specific fees are also based, in part, on fees charged by other market centers.</p>
        
        <p id="p-33" data-page="39321">For those orders routed to Nasdaq that add liquidity, a rebate of $0.0020 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;A&#x201D;). For orders routed to Nasdaq OMX BX in Tape A and C Securities and that remove liquidity, a rebate of $0.0001 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;C&#x201D;). For orders routed or re-routed to NYSE and that remove liquidity, a charge of $0.0021 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;D&#x201D;).<sup>
        [13]
      </sup>
          This charge also applies to securities priced less than $1.00. For orders routed to NYSE that add liquidity, a rebate of $0.0013 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;F&#x201D;). For orders routed to NYSE Arca in Tape A &amp; C Securities that remove liquidity, a charge of $0.0030 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;G&#x201D;). For orders routed to EDGX Exchange, Inc., a charge of $0.0029 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;I&#x201D;). For orders routed to Nasdaq that remove liquidity, a charge of $0.0030 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;J&#x201D;). For orders routed to the BATS Exchange (&#x201C;BATS&#x201D;) using a ROBA order type, a charge of $0.0025 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;K&#x201D;). A ROBA order type sweeps the EDGA book and routes to BATS Exchange as an immediate or cancel (IOC) order, with the remainder being cancelled if there is no execution.</p>
        
        <p id="p-35" data-page="39321">For orders using the ROUQ or ROUC order types, a charge of $0.0020 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;Q&#x201D;). A ROUQ order type sweeps the EDGA book, then routes to other destination centers. A ROUC order type sweeps the EDGA book, then other destination centers, then Nasdaq OMX BX, then NYSE, and the remainder posts to EDGX. For any orders that are re-routed by EDGA, a charge of $0.0030 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;R&#x201D;). For Directed Intermarket Sweep Orders<sup>
        [14]
      </sup>
          (yielding Flag &#x201C;S&#x201D;), a charge of $0.0033 per share is proposed. For orders that are routed and no other flag applies, a standard charge of $0.0029 per share applies, as discussed above (yielding Flag &#x201C;X&#x201D;). For orders that are routed using the ROUZ order type, a charge of $0.0010 per share is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;Z&#x201D;). A ROUZ order type sweeps the EDGA book before interacting with solicited orders on a price/time priority basis. For orders routed during the Pre-Opening and Post-Closing Sessions, a charge of $0.0030 per share applies (yielding Flag &#x201C;7&#x201D;). For orders that are routed using the ROUD or ROUE order types, a charge of $0.0020 is proposed (yielding Flag &#x201C;T&#x201D;). A ROUD order sweeps the EDGA book before being routed to other destination centers. A ROUE order type sweeps the EDGA book, then other destination centers, and any remainder routes to other market centers.</p>
        
        <p id="p-37" data-page="39321">The differences between the fees charged for routing to specific market centers and routing of specific order types described above are due to different cost structures at the various market centers to which orders may be routed and other factors. Similarly, lower transaction fees at other destination centers permit the Exchange to charge lower routing fees for orders routed to such venues. Because the Exchange incurs additional costs and performs additional services in connection with the routing of Directed ISOs, it charges a higher routing fee for such orders. Finally, because the Exchange believes that a uniform routing fee for all other orders routed away from the Exchange (other than those described above) provides Members with certainty as to transaction costs, it proposes to charge a standard routing fee of $0.0029 per share, as described above, for such orders, rather than further differentiating routing fees that it charges to Members.</p>
        <br><p><b>Other Charges and Flags</b></p>
        <p id="p-38" data-page="39321">For Non-Displayed Orders, a charge of $0.0010 per share is proposed and this situation yields Flag &#x201C;H.&#x201D; However, this rate is contingent upon the Member adding greater than 1,000,000 shares on a daily basis, measured monthly. It is proposed that Members not meeting this minimum will be charged $0.0030 per share. For the month of July 2010 only, the 1,000,000 monthly share volume threshold will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum of the daily consolidated volumes for each Exchange-traded symbol for all days that such symbol is traded on the Exchange during the month of July and the denominator of which shall be the monthly consolidated volume for all Exchange-traded symbols during the month of July. This calculation adjusts this volume threshold during the month of July when trading is being phased into the Exchange from Direct Edge&apos;s ECN and reflects the portion of the volume that occurs on the Exchange during the month.</p>
        <p id="p-39" data-page="39321">For customer internalization (<i>i.e,</i> same MPID),<sup>
        [15]
      </sup>
          there is no charge nor rebate because the fees for removing liquidity would be offset by the rebate received for adding liquidity. This situation yields Flag &#x201C;E.&#x201D; During the Pre-Opening and Post-Closing sessions, there are also no charges nor rebates, but this situation yields Flag &#x201C;5.&#x201D;</p>
        
        <p id="p-41" data-page="39321">For orders that execute during the Nasdaq opening cross (NOOP), it is proposed that these orders will be charged $0.0005 per share and yield Flag &#x201C;O.&#x201D; However, this fee is proposed to be capped at $10,000 per month per Member, which is a pass-through of Nasdaq&apos;s opening cross cap.</p>
        <p id="p-42" data-page="39321">For Direct Edge opening transactions, where Members match with each other at the midpoint of the national best bid/offer (&#x201C;NBBO&#x201D;) during EDGA&apos;s opening process, IPO, or post-halt, a flag of &#x201C;OO&#x201D; is proposed and there is no rebate nor charge.</p>
        <br><p><b>2. Statutory Basis</b></p>
        <p id="p-43" data-page="39321">The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the objectives of Section 6 of the Act,<sup>
        [16]
      </sup>
          in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4),<sup>
        [17]
      </sup>

          in particular, as it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
:::index 75p39322

other charges among its members and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily direct order flow to competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be excessive. The proposed rule change reflects a competitive pricing structure designed to incent market participants to direct their order flow to the Exchange. Finally, the Exchange believes that the proposed rates are equitable in that they apply uniformly to all Members and provide higher rebates for higher volume thresholds, resulting from lower administrative costs. The Exchange believes the fees and credits remain competitive with those charged by other venues and therefore continue to be reasonable and equitably allocated to those members that opt to direct orders to the Exchange rather than competing venues. Finally, the Exchange believes that the proposed rates further the objectives of Regulation NMS by promoting competition and granting fair and equal access to all exchange participants.</p>
