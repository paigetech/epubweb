Comments should refer to the docket number of this notice and the vessel name in order for MARAD to properly consider the comments. Comments should also state the commenter&apos;s interest in the waiver application, and address the waiver criteria given in &#xA7; 388.4 of MARAD&apos;s regulations at 46 CFR part 388.</p>
