          <i>Needs and Uses:</i> In 1999, the Commission released the Truth-in-Billing and Billing Format, CC Docket No. 98-170, First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, (1999 TIB Order); published at <!!ln dp_fr64 64-FR-34488p64 #64-FR-34488p64>64 FR 34488, June 25, 1999, which adopted principles and guidelines designed to reduce telecommunications fraud, such as slamming and cramming, by making bills easier for consumers to read and understand, and thereby, making such fraud easier to detect and report. In 2000, Truth-in-Billing and Billing Format, CC Docket No. 98-170, Order on Reconsideration, (2000 Reconsideration Order); published at <!!ln dp_fr65 65-FR-43251p65 #65-FR-43251p65>65 FR 43251, July 13, 2000, the Commission, granted in part petitions for reconsideration of the requirements that bills highlight new service providers and prominently display inquiry contact numbers. On March 18, 2005, the Commission released Truth-in-Billing and Billing Format; National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates&apos; Petition for Declaratory Ruling Regarding Truth-in-Billing, Second Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 98-170, CG Docket No. 04-208, (2005 Second Report and Order and Second Further Notice); published at <!!ln dp_fr70 70-FR-29979p70 #70-FR-29979p70>70 FR 29979 and <!!ln dp_fr70 70-FR-30044p70 #70-FR-30044p70>70 FR 30044, May 25, 2005, which determined, inter alia, that Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers no longer should be exempted from 47 CFR 64.2401(b), which requires billing descriptions to be brief, clear, non-misleading and in plain language. The 2005 Second Further Notice proposed and sought comment on measures to enhance the ability of consumers to make informed choices among competitive telecommunications service providers.</p>
        <p id="p-36" data-page="48982">On April 27, 2012, the Commission released the Empowering Consumers to Prevent and Detect Billing for Unauthorized Charges (&#x201C;Cramming&#x201D;), Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CG Docket No. 11-116, CG Docket No. 09-158, CC Docket No. 98-170, FCC 12-42 (Cramming Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking); published at <!!ln dp_fr77 77-FR-30972p77 #77-FR-30972p77>77 FR 30972, May 24, 2012, which determined that additional rules are needed to help consumers prevent and detect the placement of unauthorized charges on their telephone bills, an unlawful and fraudulent practice commonly referred to as &#x201C;cramming.&#x201D;</p>
