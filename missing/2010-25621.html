          notice is hereby given that on September 23, 2010, NYSE Arca, Inc. (&#x201C;NYSE Arca&#x201D; or the &#x201C;Exchange&#x201D;) filed with the Securities

The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.</p>
        
        
        
<br><p><b>I. Self-Regulatory Organization&apos;s Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-4" data-page="62906">The Exchange proposes to list and trade the following under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600 (&#x201C;Managed Fund Shares&#x201D;): Peritus High Yield ETF.

        </p>
        
<br><p><b>II. Self-Regulatory Organization&apos;s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-5" data-page="62906">In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.</p>
        <br><p><b>A. Self-Regulatory Organization&apos;s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</b></p>
        <br><p><b>1. Purpose</b></p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="62906">The Exchange proposes to list and trade the following Managed Fund Shares<sup>
        [3]
      </sup>
          (&#x201C;Shares&#x201D;) under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600: Peritus High Yield ETF (the &#x201C;Fund&#x201D;).<sup>
        [4]
      </sup>
          The Shares will be offered by AdvisorShares Trust (the &#x201C;Trust&#x201D;), a statutory trust organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company.<sup>
        [5]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        
        
        <br><p><b>Peritus High Yield ETF</b></p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="62906">The investment advisor to the Fund is AdvisorShares Investments, LLC (the &#x201C;Advisor&#x201D;). Peritus I Asset Management, LLC is the Fund&apos;s sub-advisor (&#x201C;Peritus&#x201D; or the &#x201C;Sub-Advisor&#x201D;). The Bank of New York Mellon is the administrator, transfer agent and custodian for the Fund.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="62906">Commentary .06 to Rule 8.600 provides that, if the investment adviser to the Investment Company issuing Managed Fund Shares is affiliated with a broker-dealer, such investment adviser shall erect a &#x201C;fire wall&#x201D; between the investment adviser and the broker-dealer with respect to access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to such Investment Company portfolio.<sup>
        [6]
      </sup>
          In addition, Commentary .06 further requires that personnel who make decisions on the open-end fund&apos;s portfolio composition must be subject to procedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material nonpublic information regarding the open-end fund&apos;s portfolio. The Advisor and Sub-Advisor are not affiliated with a broker-dealer.<sup>
        [7]
      </sup>
          Any additional Fund sub-advisers that are affiliated with a broker-dealer will be required to implement a fire wall with respect to such broker-dealer regarding access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to a portfolio.</p>
        
        
        <p id="p-14" data-page="62906">According to the Registration Statement, the Fund&apos;s investment objective is high current income with a secondary goal of capital appreciation. The Sub-Advisor seeks to achieve the Fund&apos;s investment objective by selecting a focused portfolio of high yield debt securities, which include senior and subordinated corporate debt obligations (such as bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper<sup>
        [8]
      </sup>
          ). The Fund does not have any portfolio maturity limitation and may invest its assets from time to time primarily in instruments with short-term, medium-term or long-term maturities.</p>
        

        <p id="p-16" data-page="62906">In selecting securities for the Fund&apos;s portfolio, Peritus performs its own independent investment analysis of each issuer to determine its creditworthiness. Peritus focuses on the
:::index 79p62907

secondary market, predominantly investing in assets at a discount to par ($100), allowing for a potential opportunity to generate capital gains in addition to current yield.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="62907">According to the Registration Statement, Peritus places limited value on credit ratings and instead focuses on true cash flow while looking to buy credit at prices that it feels provide a margin of safety. Additional factors are considered when constructing the portfolio including, but not limited to, excess cash on the balance sheet and/or a history of producing real free cash flow, as well as a capital structure that can be sustained on conservative forecasts.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="62907">According to the Registration Statement, Peritus reverse engineers the traditional financial analysis process when reviewing each issuer&apos;s creditworthiness. Each analysis considers the issuer&apos;s Statement of Cash Flows, the Balance Sheet and then the Income Statement, in that order. The investment team looks at a complete appraisal of the business&apos; intrinsic value, rather than just traditional credit analysis. Through fundamental and valuation analysis, the Sub-Advisor determines whether an investment should be made in a certain company, and where in the capital structure (secured, senior, or subordinate) the risk/return is most attractive. The Fund&apos;s portfolio will typically consist of 40-60 holdings.<sup>
        [9]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        

        <p id="p-20" data-page="62907">The Fund&apos;s portfolio holdings will be disclosed on its Web site (<i>http://www.advisorshares.com</i>) daily after the close of trading on the Exchange and prior to the opening of trading on the Exchange the following day.</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="62907">According to the Registration Statement, the Fund may invest in debt securities and may seek investment in corporate debt securities representative of one or more high yield bond or credit derivative indices, which may change from time to time. Selection will generally be dependent on independent credit analysis or fundamental analysis performed by the Sub-Advisor.<sup>
        [10]
      </sup>
          The Fund may invest in all grades of corporate securities including below investment grade.<sup>
        [11]
      </sup>
          The Fund will only invest in liquid securities. The Fund will only purchase performing securities, not distressed debt.<sup>
        [12]
      </sup>
          To a lesser extent, the Fund also may invest in unrated securities.</p>
        
        
        
        <p id="p-25" data-page="62907">The Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies to the extent that such an investment would be consistent with the requirements of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, or any rule, regulation or order of the SEC.</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="62907">The Fund may make short-term investments in U.S. Government securities and may invest in U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds.</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="62907">To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the Fund may invest 100% of its total assets, without limitation, in high-quality short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Fund may be invested in these instruments for extended periods, depending on the Sub-Advisor&apos;s assessment of market conditions. These short-term debt securities and money market instruments include shares of other mutual funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, bankers&apos; acceptances, and U.S. Government securities.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="62907">The Fund is subject to the following investment limitations:</p>
        <p id="p-29" data-page="62907">Diversification. The Fund may not (i) with respect to 75% of its total assets, purchase securities of any issuer (except securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities or shares of investment companies) if, as a result, more than 5% of its total assets would be invested in the securities of such issuer; or (ii) acquire more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer. For purposes of this policy, the issuer of a Depository Receipt will be deemed to be the issuer of the respective underlying security.<sup>
        [13]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        <p id="p-31" data-page="62907">Concentration. The Fund may not invest 25% or more of its total assets in the securities of one or more issuers conducting their principal business activities in the same industry or group of industries. The Fund will not invest 25% or more of its total assets in any investment company that so concentrates. This limitation does not apply to investments in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities, or shares of investment companies. For purposes of this policy, the issuer of a Depository Receipt will be deemed to be the issuer of the respective underlying security.</p>
        <p id="p-32" data-page="62907">The Fund, under normal circumstances, will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in high yield debt securities. The Fund intends to maintain the level of diversification necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</p>
        <p id="p-33" data-page="62907">The Shares will conform to the initial and continued listing criteria under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600. The Exchange represents that, for initial and/or continued listing, the Fund will be in compliance with Rule 10A-3<sup>
        [14]
      </sup>
          under the Exchange Act, as provided by NYSE Arca Equities Rule 5.3. A minimum of 100,000 Shares will be outstanding at the commencement of trading on the Exchange. The Exchange will obtain a representation from the issuer of the Shares that the net asset value (&#x201C;NAV&#x201D;) and the Disclosed Portfolio will be made available to all market participants at the same time.</p>
        
        <p id="p-35" data-page="62907">The Fund will not invest in non-US issues.</p>
        <br><p><b>Creations and Redemptions of Shares</b></p>
        <p id="p-36" data-page="62907">The Trust issues and sells Shares of the Fund only in Creation Units of 50,000 Shares on a continuous basis through the Distributor, at their NAV next determined after receipt, on any Business Day (as defined in the Registration Statement). The consideration for purchase of a Creation Unit of the Fund generally consists of an in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities (the &#x201C;Deposit Securities&#x201D;) per each Creation Unit constituting securities included in the Fund&apos;s portfolio and an amount of cash (the &#x201C;Cash Component&#x201D;) computed as described in the Registration Statement. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the &#x201C;Fund Deposit,&#x201D; which represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. Creations and redemption of Shares may be effected only by Authorized Participants, as defined in the Registration Statement.<sup>
        [15]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        <p id="p-38" data-page="62907">Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Fund through the Administrator and only on a Business Day. The Trust will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units.</p>

        <p id="p-39" data-page="62907">Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for the Fund, the
:::index 79p62908

redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities (securities included in the Fund&apos;s portfolio)&#x2014;as announced by the Administrator on the Business Day of the request for redemption received in proper form&#x2014;plus cash in an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in proper form, and the value of the Fund Securities (the &#x201C;Cash Redemption Amount&#x201D;), less a redemption transaction fee. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the differential is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder.</p>
        <br><p><b>Availability of Information</b></p>
        <p id="p-40" data-page="62908">The Fund&apos;s Web site (<i>http://www.advisorshares.com</i>), which will be publicly available prior to the public offering of Shares, will include a form of the Prospectus for the Fund that may be downloaded. The Fund&apos;s Web site will include additional quantitative information updated on a daily basis, including, for the Fund, (1) daily trading volume, the prior business day&apos;s reported closing price, NAV and mid-point of the bid/ask spread at the time of calculation of such NAV (the &#x201C;Bid/Ask Price&#x201D;),<sup>

          and a calculation of the premium and discount of the Bid/Ask Price against the NAV, and (2) data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the daily Bid/Ask Price against the NAV, within appropriate ranges, for each of the four previous calendar quarters. On each business day, before commencement of trading in Shares in the Core Trading Session on the Exchange, the Fund will disclose on its Web site the Disclosed Portfolio as defined in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600(c)(2) that will form the basis for the Fund&apos;s calculation of NAV at the end of the business day.<sup>
        [17]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        
        <p id="p-43" data-page="62908">On a daily basis, the Advisor will disclose for each portfolio security or other financial instrument of the Fund the following information: Ticker symbol (if applicable), name of security or financial instrument, number of shares or dollar value of financial instruments held in the portfolio, and percentage weighting of the security or financial instrument in the portfolio. The Web site information will be publicly available at no charge. In addition, price information for the debt securities held by the Fund will be available through major market data vendors.</p>
        <p id="p-44" data-page="62908">In addition, a basket composition file, which includes the security names and share quantities required to be delivered in exchange for Fund shares, together with estimates and actual cash components, will be publicly disseminated daily prior to the opening of the New York Stock Exchange (&#x201C;NYSE&#x201D;) via the National Securities Clearing Corporation. The basket represents one Creation Unit of the Fund. The NAV of the Fund will normally be determined as of the close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day.</p>

        <p id="p-45" data-page="62908">Investors can also obtain the Trust&apos;s Statement of Additional Information (&#x201C;SAI&#x201D;), the Fund&apos;s Shareholder Reports, and its Form N-CSR and Form N-SAR, filed twice a year.

In addition, the Portfolio Indicative Value, as defined in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600 (c)(3), will be disseminated by one or more major market data vendors at least every 15 seconds during the Core Trading Session. The dissemination of the Portfolio Indicative Value, together with the Disclosed Portfolio, will allow investors to determine the value of the underlying portfolio of the Fund on a daily basis and to provide a close estimate of that value throughout the trading day.</p>
        <p id="p-46" data-page="62908">Additional information regarding the Trust and the Shares, including investment strategies, risks, creation and redemption procedures, fees, portfolio holdings disclosure policies, distributions and taxes is included in the Registration Statement.</p>
        <br><p><b>Trading Halts</b></p>
        <p id="p-47" data-page="62908">With respect to trading halts, the Exchange may consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt or suspend trading in the Shares of the Fund.<sup>
        [18]
      </sup>
          Trading in Shares of the Fund will be halted if the circuit breaker parameters in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.12 have been reached. Trading also may be halted because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) The extent to which trading is not occurring in the securities comprising the Disclosed Portfolio and/or the financial instruments of the Fund; or (2) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present. Trading in the Shares will be subject to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600(d)(2)(D), which sets forth circumstances under which Shares of the Fund may be halted.</p>
        
        <br><p><b>Trading Rules</b></p>
        <p id="p-49" data-page="62908">The Exchange deems the Shares to be equity securities, thus rendering trading in the Shares subject to the Exchange&apos;s existing rules governing the trading of equity securities. Shares will trade on the NYSE Arca Marketplace from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Time in accordance with NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.34 (Opening, Core, and Late Trading Sessions). The Exchange has appropriate rules to facilitate transactions in the Shares during all trading sessions. As provided in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.6, Commentary .03, the minimum price variation (&#x201C;MPV&#x201D;) for quoting and entry of orders in equity securities traded on the NYSE Arca Marketplace is $0.01, with the exception of securities that are priced less than $1.00 for which the MPV for order entry is $0.0001.</p>
        <br><p><b>Surveillance</b></p>
        <p id="p-50" data-page="62908">The Exchange intends to utilize its existing surveillance procedures applicable to derivative products (which include Managed Fund Shares) to monitor trading in the Shares. The Exchange represents that these procedures are adequate to properly monitor Exchange trading of the Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect violations of Exchange rules and applicable federal securities laws.</p>

        <p id="p-51" data-page="62908">The Exchange&apos;s current trading surveillance focuses on detecting
:::index 79p62909

securities trading outside their normal patterns. When such situations are detected, surveillance analysis follows and investigations are opened, where appropriate, to review the behavior of all relevant parties for all relevant trading violations.</p>
        <p id="p-52" data-page="62909">The Exchange may obtain information via the Intermarket Surveillance Group (&#x201C;ISG&#x201D;) from other exchanges that are members of ISG or with which the Exchange has entered into a surveillance sharing agreement.<sup>
        [19]
      </sup>
          
        </p>
        
        <p id="p-54" data-page="62909">In addition, the Exchange also has a general policy prohibiting the distribution of material, non-public information by its employees.</p>
        <br><p><b>Information Bulletin</b></p>
        <p id="p-55" data-page="62909">Prior to the commencement of trading, the Exchange will inform its Equity Trading Permit (&#x201C;ETP&#x201D;) Holders in an Information Bulletin (&#x201C;Bulletin&#x201D;) of the special characteristics and risks associated with trading the Shares. Specifically, the Bulletin will discuss the following: (1) The procedures for purchases and redemptions of Shares in Creation Unit aggregations (and that Shares are not individually redeemable); (2) NYSE Arca Equities Rule 9.2(a), which imposes a duty of due diligence on its ETP Holders to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading the Shares; (3) the risks involved in trading the Shares during the Opening and Late Trading Sessions when an updated Portfolio Indicative Value will not be calculated or publicly disseminated; (4) how information regarding the Portfolio Indicative Value is disseminated; (5) the requirement that ETP Holders deliver a prospectus to investors purchasing newly issued Shares prior to or concurrently with the confirmation of a transaction; and (6) trading information.</p>
        <p id="p-56" data-page="62909">In addition, the Bulletin will reference that the Fund is subject to various fees and expenses described in the Registration Statement. The Bulletin will discuss any exemptive, no-action, and interpretive relief granted by the Commission from any rules under the Exchange Act. The Bulletin will also disclose that the NAV for the Shares will be calculated after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time each trading day.</p>
        <br><p><b>2. Statutory Basis</b></p>
        <p id="p-57" data-page="62909">The basis under the Exchange Act for this proposed rule change is the requirement under Section 6(b)(5)<sup>
        [20]
      </sup>
          that an exchange have rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate the listing and trading of an additional type of actively-managed exchange-traded product that will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and the marketplace.</p>
        
        <br><p><b>B. Self-Regulatory Organization&apos;s Statement on Burden on Competition</b></p>
        <p id="p-59" data-page="62909">The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.</p>
