        <p id="p-8" data-page="62842">The Mandatory Guidelines were initially developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564 and section 503 of 100. The &#x201C;Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs,&#x201D; as amended in the revisions listed above, requires strict standards that Laboratories and Instrumented Initial Testing Facilities (IITF) must meet in order to conduct drug and specimen validity tests on urine specimens for Federal agencies.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="62842">To become certified, an applicant Laboratory/IITF must undergo three rounds of performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification, a Laboratory/IITF must participate in a quarterly performance testing program plus undergo periodic, on-site inspections.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="62842">Laboratories and IITFs in the applicant stage of certification do not meet the minimum requirements described in the HHS Mandatory Guidelines. A Laboratory/IITF must have its letter of certification from HHS/SAMHSA (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="62842">In accordance with the Mandatory Guidelines dated April 30, 2010 (<!!ln dp_fr75 75-FR-22809p75 #75-FR-22809p75>75 FR 22809), the following Laboratories and Instrumented Initial Testing Facilities (IITF) meet the minimum standards to conduct drug and specimen validity tests on urine specimens:</p>

        <p id="p-51" data-page="62843">* The Standards Council of Canada (SCC) voted to end its Laboratory Accreditation Program for Substance Abuse (LAPSA) effective May 12, 1998. Laboratories certified through that program were accredited to conduct forensic urine drug testing as required by U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. As of that date, the certification of those accredited Canadian laboratories will continue under DOT authority. The responsibility for conducting quarterly performance testing plus periodic on-site inspections of those LAPSA-accredited laboratories was transferred to the U.S. HHS, with the HHS&apos; NLCP contractor continuing to have an active role in the performance testing and laboratory inspection processes. Other Canadian laboratories wishing to be considered for the NLCP may apply directly to the NLCP contractor just as U.S. laboratories do.</p>

        <p id="p-52" data-page="62843">Upon finding a Canadian laboratory to be qualified, HHS will recommend that DOT certify the laboratory (<span>Federal Register</span>, July 16, 1996) as meeting the minimum standards of the Mandatory Guidelines published in the <span>Federal Register</span> on April 30, 2010 (<!!ln dp_fr75 75-FR-22809p75 #75-FR-22809p75>75 FR 22809). After receiving DOT certification, the laboratory will be included in the monthly list of HHS-certified laboratories and participate in the NLCP certification maintenance program.</p>
