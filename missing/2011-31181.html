          <i>Abstract:</i> On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (also known as CAFTA-DR). The Agreement was approved by Congress in section 101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 109-53, 119 Stat. 462) (19 U.S.C. 4001) and provides for preferential tariff treatment of certain goods originating in one or more of the CAFTA-DR countries. It was signed into law on August 2, 2005.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="75894">In order to ascertain if imported goods are eligible for preferential tariff treatment or duty refunds under CAFTA-DR, CBP collects information such as name and contact information for importer and exporter; information about the producer of the good; a description of the good; the HTSUS tariff classification; and the applicable rule of origin. In addition, a certification and supporting documents may be requested by CBP in order to substantiate the claim for preferential tariff treatment. This collection of information is provided for by 19 CFR 10.583 through 19 CFR 10.592.</p>
