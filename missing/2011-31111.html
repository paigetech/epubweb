<br><p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-11" data-page="75875">DoD is interested in obtaining input from the public with regard to the risks to the contractors and the Government associated with using open source software on DoD contracts in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
<li id="p-12" data-page="75875"> What are the risks that open source software may include proprietary or copyrighted material incorporated into the open source software without the authorization of the actual author, thereby exposing the Government and contractors who use or deliver the open source software to potential copyright infringement liability?</li>
        <li id="p-13" data-page="75875"> Are contractors facing performance and warranty deficiencies to the extent that the open source software does not meet contract requirements, and the open source software license leaves the contractors without recourse?</li>
        <li id="p-14" data-page="75875"> To what extent should the DFARS be revised to specify clearly the rights the Government obtains when a contractor acquires open source software for the Government, and why?</li>
</ul>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="75875">
