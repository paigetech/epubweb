    <p id="p-3" data-page="75857">EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD) portion of the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions concern volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from architectural coatings and automotive refinishing operations. We are proposing to approve two local rules to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act).</p>

<br><p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-12" data-page="75857">This proposal addresses the following local rules: PCAPCD Rule 218, Architectural Coatings and Rule 234, Automotive Refinishing Operations. In the Rules and Regulations section of this <span>Federal Register</span>, we are approving these local rules in a direct final action without prior proposal because we believe these SIP revisions are not controversial. If we receive adverse comments, however, we will publish a timely withdrawal of the direct final rule and address the comments in subsequent action based on this proposed rule. Please note that if we receive adverse comment on an amendment, paragraph, or section of this rule and if that provision may be severed from the remainder of the rule, we may adopt as final those provisions of the rule that are not the subject of an adverse comment.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="75857">We do not plan to open a second comment period, so anyone interested in commenting should do so at this time. If we do not receive adverse comments, no further activity is planned. For further information, please see the direct final action.</p>
