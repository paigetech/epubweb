<br><p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-4" data-page="62895">The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering the issuance of a license to AREVA Enrichment Services (AES) LLC (the applicant) to authorize construction of a gas centrifuge enrichment facility and possession and use of byproduct material, source material, and special nuclear material. This proposed facility is known as the Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility (EREF) and will be located in Bonneville County, Idaho. The NRC has prepared a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in support of this license application.</p>
        
<br><p><b>II. Summary 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-5" data-page="62895">By letter dated December 30, 2008, the applicant submitted to the NRC, an application requesting a license, under Title 10 of the <i>Code of Federal Regulations</i> Parts 30, 40, and 70, to possess and use byproduct material, source material, and special nuclear material in a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facility. The applicant proposes that the facility, known as the EREF, be located in Bonneville County, Idaho, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) west-northwest of the city of Idaho Falls. By letter dated April 23, 2009, AES submitted a revised application to increase the facility&apos;s nominal capacity from 3 million separative work units (SWU)/year to 6 million SWUs/year. The applicant subsequently revised its license application by letter dated April 30, 2010.</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="62895">The NRC staff has prepared the SER in support of this license application. The SER discusses the results of the safety review performed by the staff in the following areas: General information, organization and administration, integrated safety analysis (ISA) and ISA summary, radiation protection, nuclear criticality safety, chemical process safety, fire safety, emergency management, environmental protection, decommissioning, management measures, physical protection, and materials control and accountability.</p>
