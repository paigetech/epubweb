    <p id="p-3" data-page="75858">We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 6-month extension of the final determination of whether to list the dunes sagebrush lizard (<i>Sceloporus arenicolus</i>) (lizard) as endangered and reopen the comment period on the proposed rule to list the species. We are taking this action because there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the proposed listing rule, making it necessary to solicit additional information by reopening the comment period for 45 days.</p>

<br><p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
</b></p>
<br><p><b>Background 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-10" data-page="75858">On December 14, 2010, we published a proposed rule (<!!ln dp_fr75 75-FR-77801p75 #75-FR-77801p75>75 FR 77801) to list the dunes sagebrush lizard, a lizard known from southeastern New Mexico and adjacent west Texas, as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 <i>et seq.</i>). For a description of previous Federal actions concerning the dunes sagebrush lizard (formerly known as the sand dunes lizard), please refer to the proposed rule. In addition to the original comment period associated with the publication of the proposed rule, we held two public meetings in April 2011 and reopened the comment period to accept additional public comments (<!!ln dp_fr76 76-FR-19304p76 #76-FR-19304p76>76 FR 19304, April 7, 2011). That comment period closed on May 9, 2011.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="75858">Section 4(b)(6) of the Act requires that we take one of three actions within 1 year of a proposed listing: (1) Finalize the proposed listing; (2) withdraw the proposed listing; or (3) extend the final determination by not more than 6 months, if there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the determination, for the purposes of soliciting additional data.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="75858">Since the publication of the proposed rule, there has been substantial disagreement regarding the interpretation of the limited surveys used to determine the dunes sagebrush lizard&apos;s status and trends. This has led to a significant disagreement regarding the current conservation status of the species in New Mexico and Texas. In addition, there was sparse information on the dunes sagebrush lizard&apos;s presence in Texas, leading to substantial disagreement on the accuracy of our analysis of the status of the lizard in Texas.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="75858">Therefore, in consideration of the disagreements surrounding the lizard&apos;s status, we are extending the final determination for 6 months in order to solicit information that will help to clarify these issues.</p>
        
<br><p><b>Public Comments 
</b></p>


        <p id="p-14" data-page="75858">We will accept written comments and information during this reopened comment period on our proposed listing for the dunes sagebrush lizard that was published in the <span>Federal Register</span> on December 14, 2010 (<!!ln dp_fr75 75-FR-77801p75 #75-FR-77801p75>75 FR 77801). We will consider information and recommendations from all interested parties. We intend that any final action resulting from this proposal be as accurate as possible and based on the best available scientific and commercial data.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="75858">Therefore, in consideration of the disagreements surrounding the lizard&apos;s status, we are extending the final determination for 6 months in order to solicit information that will help to clarify these issues. We are particularly interested in new information regarding:</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="75858">(1) Population estimates of the dunes sagebrush lizard in New Mexico and Texas.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="75858">(2) Data that quantify the current amount of habitat and the loss of habitat.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="75858">(3) Survey information, including maps, throughout the dunes sagebrush lizard&apos;s range, especially for Texas.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="75858">In addition to our request for new information, we are also reopening the comment period to ensure the public has full access to and an opportunity to comment on all the available information we have received since the second comment period closed. We have received new survey information for the lizard in New Mexico and Texas and an unsolicited peer review study on our proposed rule. We are soliciting input from concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning the proposed rule in light of this additional information.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="75858">If you previously submitted comments or information on the proposed rule, please do not resubmit them. We have incorporated them into the public record, and we will fully consider them in the preparation of our final determination. Our final determination concerning this proposed listing will take into consideration all written comments and any additional information we received.</p>

        <p id="p-21" data-page="75858">You may submit your comments and materials concerning the proposed rule by one of the methods listed in <span>ADDRESSES</span>. We request that you send comments only by the methods described in <span>ADDRESSES</span>.</p>
