        <p id="p-9" data-page="62755">The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) is charged with developing recommendations for the improvement of Federal administrative procedures (5 U.S.C. 591). The objectives of these recommendations are to ensure that private rights may be fully protected and regulatory activities and other Federal responsibilities may be carried out expeditiously in the public interest, to promote more effective public participation and efficiency in the rulemaking process, to reduce unnecessary litigation in the regulatory process, to improve the use of science in the regulatory process, and to improve the effectiveness of laws applicable to the regulatory process.</p>

        <p id="p-10" data-page="62755">The Conference has engaged a Professor of Law at New York University School of Law, Catherine M. Sharkey, to research and prepare a report regarding the best practices of federal agencies in obtaining input from state and local governments and other procedures for determining whether to preempt state law (the &#x201C;Preemption Report&#x201D;). The Committee on Regulation is already scheduled to meet on October 19, 2010 to discuss the Preemption Report, a copy of which is available at <i>http://www.acus.gov.</i> The Committee on Regulation has been tasked with reviewing this report and developing recommendations for consideration by the Assembly of the Conference. A draft recommendation will be prepared based upon the Preemption Report (the &#x201C;Preemption Recommendation&#x201D;).</p>

        <p id="p-11" data-page="62755">From 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on November 2, 2010, the Committee on Regulation will hold a second public meeting to consider the Preemption Recommendation.

Members of the public are invited to attend the meeting in person, subject to space limitations, and the Conference will also provide remote public access to the meeting.
