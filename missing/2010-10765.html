<br><p><b>I. Overview 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-19" data-page="25185">On January 22, 2010, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) published its Second Round NOFA at <!!ln dp_fr74 74-FR-3820p74 #74-FR-3820p74>74 FR 3820, identifying new funding opportunities for Satellite, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance projects. In that Second Round NOFA, the Agency also noted that more specific requirements would be outlined in a future Request for Proposals (RFP). This RFP details those requirements with respect to application contents, as well as eligible expenses under each funding opportunity. Generally, the following changes have been made to each funding opportunity:</p>
        <br><p><b>Satellite</b></p>

        <p id="p-20" data-page="25185">For Satellite projects, there have been no major changes to the information required in the application except for the proposed amount per subscriber that is requested in federal assistance (&#x201C;Proposed Subscriber Amount&#x201D;). This amount represents the Applicant&apos;s bid to provide the required terms of service, in addition to any other proposed terms, to any unserved premises in the Satellite Region. The eligible costs provision has correspondingly been modified to reflect that such costs will be reimbursed on the proposed subscriber amount agreed to by the Agency. How a successful Applicant applies the grant funds per subscriber shall be at its discretion. In addition, the requirement that an Applicant offer a reduced service package of at least 25 percent of its December 2009 published rates has been eliminated. Upon reflection, the Agency has determined that such a requirement may not accomplish the desired effect, given that some providers may already offer better rates than other discounted rates, and that such an aggressive discount may not be feasible. Moreover, imposition of the requirement would be unfair to existing companies given that new
:::index 79p25186

entrants or consortiums would not have existing rates. As such, the Agency is eliminating the 25 percent discount requirement, but now requires that the cost of its Basic Service Package, as defined in this RFP, not exceed $50 per month.</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="25186">The Agency will accept National Applications which cover at least six of the eight Satellite Regions, in addition to Regional Applications that cover one or more Satellite Regions. However, if an applicant chooses to submit a National Application, it must submit one national proposed subscriber amount, whereas Regional Applications may contain distinct regional proposed subscriber amounts in their regional break out. An applicant may submit both a National Application and a Regional Application covering the same Satellite Regions for consideration.</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="25186">In addition, the Agency has determined that reaching hard to serve unserved rural premises may best be served by awarding more than one Regional or National applicant for the same Satellite Region, depending on the proposals it receives.</p>
        <br><p><b>Rural Library Broadband</b></p>
        <p id="p-23" data-page="25186">For Rural Library Broadband projects, there also have been no changes to the requirements of the application, but the scope of eligible costs has been amplified to encompass associated costs with hardware and software to connect the Rural Libraries. Connecting the Rural Library to a broadband network without the necessary equipment to that connection would not serve the purposes of the program.</p>
        <br><p><b>Technical Assistance</b></p>
        <p id="p-24" data-page="25186">For Technical Assistance projects, the requirements of the application have been clarified with respect to the objective of the plan. Moreover, Indian tribes are not required to receive a BIP or BTOP award in order to be eligible to receive a grant for Technical Assistance.</p>
        <p id="p-25" data-page="25186">Eligible costs also have been modified to include up to five percent of pre-application expenses so that Applicants may adequately lay out their proposal in sufficient detail.</p>
        <br><p><b>Rural Library Broadband and Technical Assistance</b></p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="25186">For both Rural Library Broadband and Technical Assistance projects, eligible entities have been amended to clarify that in addition to the Awardees under the First Round NOFA and Second Round NOFA, only Applicants for the Second Round NOFA that ultimately receive an Award under that NOFA will be considered for these projects. Given the timing of this RFP, all Awardees under the Second Round NOFA have not been determined. As such, Round Two Applicants that have not yet been notified of the status of their application may submit an application for Rural Library Broadband and Technical Assistance projects at their own risk.</p>
        <br><p><b>Satellite, Rural Library Broadband and Technical Assistance</b></p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="25186">Some definitions have been added to effectuate the requirements of Satellite, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance projects.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="25186">Based on the number of estimated applicants the Agency expects to receive for all three projects, it has determined that the cost of developing an online intake system would not be an effective use of Agency resources. Therefore, all applications under this RFP must be submitted in paper format.</p>

        <br><p><b>1. Satellite Projects</b></p>
        <p id="p-66" data-page="25187">Applicants must propose to serve only unserved rural premises in any of the Satellite Regions listed in Section IV.C.1(a) of this RFP. Applicants may propose to serve more than one Satellite Region by submitting a Regional Application which is broken out for each Satellite Region it proposes to serve, and/or by submitting a National Application covering at least six of the Satellite Regions. National Applications, however, must contain only one national proposed subscriber amount, whereas Regional Applications broken out for each Satellite Region may contain distinct proposed subscriber amounts. One or two Applicants may be selected to serve each Satellite Region. Funds will be disbursed among the eight Satellite Regions listed in Section IV.C.1(a), as the Agency determines is necessary to promote geographic diversity of funding throughout each Satellite Region, and funds will be divided within the same Satellite Region, if two awardees are chosen, based on the strength of each proposal.</p>
        <p id="p-67" data-page="25187">At a minimum, an application for Satellite projects must commit to providing no cost customer premise equipment CPE (including no installation, activation, or other fees) for all packages offered. In addition, the Basic Service Package must be offered at a rate no higher than $50 per month for at least one year with no length of service requirements, unless the Applicant offers the Basic Service Package at less than $40 per month. In such case, the Applicant may propose a one-year contract requirement, if an unconditional 30-day cancellation clause is provided. There are no length of service requirements or price requirements for Expanded Service Packages or Commercial Service Packages.</p>
        <p id="p-68" data-page="25187">If no applications are received for a given Satellite Region, the Administrator may request applications for that Satellite Region from existing Applicants under this RFP. Moreover, if the Administrator determines that no applications are acceptable for a Satellite Region, the Agency may request Applicants that submitted applications for that Satellite Region to submit amended applications. If the Agency is still unable to receive an acceptable application from such Applicants, then the Administrator reserves the right to request applications from Applicants for other Satellite Regions, or not to award the Satellite Region.</p>
        <br><p><b>2. Rural Library Broadband Grants</b></p>
        <p id="p-69" data-page="25187">Awardees under the First Round NOFA or Second Round NOFA, or Applicants under the Second Round NOFA may submit a grant request for providing a broadband connection to any rural library in their proposed funded service area that was constructed or to be constructed with funding from USDA&apos;s Community Facilities program of the Rural Housing Service and that is without broadband service. The grant request must include the broadband connection to such rural library. Such costs need not have been addressed in the original application submitted under the First Round NOFA or Second Round NOFA. If the costs were addressed, however, in the original application, the Applicant may request that such costs be converted to grant funds. Rural libraries that already have a broadband connection are ineligible for this program.</p>

        <p id="p-70" data-page="25187">In addition to the connection to these unserved rural libraries, Applicants may also request funds to accommodate up to 10 workstations, as well as critical End-user Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment, as defined herein, to ensure that broadband service is not only
:::index 79p25188

available, but can be used by the residents of the community to be served.</p>
        <p id="p-71" data-page="25188">If the Applicant will not be solely responsible for grant assets located in the rural library, then the rural library must be a co-applicant for the grant.</p>
        <br><p><b>3. Technical Assistance Grants</b></p>

        <p id="p-72" data-page="25188">Awardees under the First Round NOFA or Second Round NOFA, Applicants under the Second Round NOFA, or Indian Tribes may submit an additional grant request for funding regional broadband development planning activities associated with regions or USDA Regions in rural areas. In order to leverage these grants with the Rural Business Opportunity Grants (RBOG) of USDA&apos;s Rural Business&#x2014;Cooperative Service (RBS), <i>see</i> <!!ln dp_fr75 75-FR-15406p75 #75-FR-15406p75>75 FR 15406 (Mar. 29, 2010), RUS is likewise encouraging applications that are designed to help rural areas in the region create wealth so that they are self-sustaining, repopulating, and thriving economically. Applicants must specifically address the following RBOG key strategy: <i>Use of broadband and other critical infrastructure as a strategy to facilitate local entrepreneurship and expansion of market opportunities for small businesses.</i> Similar to the RBOG program, RUS also seeks applications that attempt to promote broadband strategies through a regional approach. Regions can be either multi-jurisdictional areas within a state, territory, or Federally-designated tribal land or can cross state, territory, or tribal boundaries, either defined by the applicant or defined or designated by the Secretary.</p>
        <p id="p-73" data-page="25188">Regional applications should focus on the broadband-related outcomes that promote economic integration and cohesion of their self-defined geographic area. This approach is intended to combine the resources of the Agency with those of State and local governments, educational institutions, and the private and nonprofit sectors to implement regional economic and community development strategies. In addition, in order to effectively leverage other resources, Applicants should identify other related programs such as those of the Department of Transportation, Health and Human Services, Education, Homeland Security, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Telemedicine Program of the Indian Health Service, and similar State and local programs. For example, a local community with limited broadband connectivity has proposed an industrial park to bring new jobs to the community. A regional proposal could include the proposal for a new industrial park identifying and leveraging State and Federal Department of Transportation resources for road construction, broadband infrastructure loans and grant from the RUS, and resources from Health and Human for a regional hospital and business models to attract new businesses to the area. The goal being to develop comprehensive plans that foster collaboration and leveraging of resources between local, state and federal agencies and focus on wealth and job creation through the use of broadband. Regional broadband development strategy proposals may be used by Awardees and regionally-based community leaders to support applications for other local, federal and state programs in order to meet the overall objectives of the plan.</p>
        <p id="p-74" data-page="25188">By fostering the development of rigorous regional broadband strategies, RUS anticipates that Technical Assistance Awardees will also be able to submit more focused applications in the future to RUS&apos; Infrastructure Telecommunications, Rural Broadband Access, Community-Oriented Connectivity Broadband, and Distance Learning and Telemedicine grant and loan programs. As such, Applicants are encouraged to consider the creation of a market study, an engineering plan for a broadband network, and a pro forma financial analysis of any potential loan.</p>
        <p id="p-75" data-page="25188">Applicants are encouraged to consider all available resources in their geographic area that can contribute to supporting this broadband strategy. After selection, in addition to grant funding under this RFP, grantees may be provided with targeted technical assistance by USDA or other federal agencies as available and appropriate. To ensure that a broad range of communities have the opportunity to benefit from the program, individual grants will be limited to $200,000. The amount of the request should cover the costs of developing the plan. RUS, in its discretion, may decrease the requested award amount based on its evaluation of an application and based on the level of funding available for this program.</p>

however, existing service areas where broadband capable service is in the process of being built-out by current RUS borrowers, or the service areas of Last Mile Awardees under the First Round NOFA, Second Round NOFA, or BTOP NOFA shall be ineligible for grant funding, regardless of whether the premises are unserved. Applicants may submit an application for more than one Satellite Region; however, each Satellite Region in the application must be broken out so that the Agency can analyze the proposal for each Satellite Region individually. Applicants may also submit a National Application covering at least six Satellite Regions, but such application will be limited to providing only one proposed subscriber amount for federal assistance.</p>
        <p id="p-155" data-page="25191">Regional and National Applications will be evaluated on the strength of their proposals and the extent to which unserved rural premises will benefit under their proposals. The price of the service to the end-user, the proposed subscriber amount, the length of any proposed discounted service, the quality and transmission speed of the proposed services, especially the Basic Service Package, how potential requests for service will be handled, and the amount of outside investment in the project will all be considered as a whole.</p>
        <p id="p-156" data-page="25191">Successful Applicants will be notified of the details of the award, and must accept the offer within the time specified in the grant offer. Applicants that are not able to do so will be rejected, and the next qualifying Applicant may be selected for the Satellite Region. RUS, at its discretion, reserves the right to decline funding in any Satellite Region for which no satisfactory application is received.</p>
        <p id="p-157" data-page="25191">Awardees will be advanced funds no more than once per month for reimbursing the connection of new unserved, rural premises. The Awardee shall be entitled to the approved proposed subscriber amount of federal assistance for each new eligible subscriber.</p>
        <p id="p-158" data-page="25191">If no applications are received for a given Satellite Region, the Administrator may request applications for that Satellite Region from existing Applicants under this RFP. Moreover, if the Administrator determines that no applications are acceptable for a Satellite Region, the Agency may request Applicants that submitted applications for that Satellite Region to submit amended applications. If the Agency is still unable to receive an acceptable application from such Applicants, then the Administrator reserves the right to request applications from Applicants for other Satellite Regions, or not to award the Satellite Region.</p>

The quality of the broadband service being provided, the length of any proposed free service or additional discounted service, the conditions of the community to be served, such as unemployment rate or income levels, and the reasonableness of costs will all be considered as a whole. RUS, in its discretion, may increase or decrease the requested award amount based on its evaluation of the reasonableness of the costs and the level of funding available for this program.</p>

          <p id="p-218" data-page="25194">(c) <i>Evaluation of project proposals.</i> If the Federal Government determines that an exception based on unreasonable cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods applies, the Federal Government will evaluate a project requesting exception to the requirements of section 1605 of the Recovery Act by adding to the estimated total cost of the project 25 percent of the project cost if foreign iron, steel, or manufactured goods are used based on unreasonable cost of comparable domestic iron, steel, or manufactured goods.</p>
          <p id="p-219" data-page="25194">(d) <i>Alternate project proposals.</i>
          </p>
          <p id="p-220" data-page="25194">(1) When a project proposal includes foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, other than designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, that are not listed by the Federal Government in this Buy American notice in the request for applications or proposals, the Applicant may submit an alternate proposal based on use of equivalent domestic or designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.</p>
          <p id="p-221" data-page="25194">(2) If an alternate proposal is submitted, the Applicant shall submit a separate cost comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs 2 CFR 176.160(c) and (d) for the proposal that is based on the use of any foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods for which the Federal Government has not yet determined if an exception applies.</p>
          <p id="p-222" data-page="25194">(3) If the Federal Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with 2 CFR 176.160(b) does not apply, the Federal Government will evaluate only those proposals based on use of the equivalent domestic or designated country iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods, and the Applicant shall be required to furnish such domestic or designated country items.</p>
        
        <br><p><b>O. Executive Order 12866</b></p>
        <p id="p-223" data-page="25194">The Recovery Act appropriated $2.5 billion to RUS for broadband grants and loans. Of that, this RFP reserves $2 million for Rural Library Broadband projects and $3 million for Technical Assistance projects. The Agency has determined that these programs are not &#x201C;economically significant.&#x201D; This RFP also reserves $100 million for Satellite projects, which may be supplemented by funds that remain available under the First Round NOFA and Second Round NOFA. The Agency has determined this program to be &#x201C;economically significant&#x201D; under Executive Order 12866, and has accordingly performed an economic analysis outlining the costs and benefits of implementing the Satellite program. The complete analysis is available from RUS upon request. Awards for all three programs must be made no later than September 30, 2010.</p>
        <br><p><b>P. Executive Order 13132
</b></p>
        <p id="p-224" data-page="25194">It has been determined that this notice does not contain policies with federalism implications as that term is defined in Executive Order 13132.</p>
        <br><p><b>Q. Administrative Procedure Act Statement</b></p>
        <p id="p-225" data-page="25194">This RFP is being issued without advance rulemaking or public comment. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, as amended (5 U.S.C. 553) (APA), has several exemptions to rulemaking requirements. Among them is an exemption for &#x201C;good cause&#x201D; found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), which allows effective government action without rulemaking procedures where withholding the action would be &#x201C;impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.&#x201D;</p>

        <p id="p-226" data-page="25194">USDA has determined, consistent with the APA that making these funds available under this RFP for broadband development, as mandated by the Recovery Act, is in the public interest. Given the emergency nature of the Recovery Act and the extremely short time period within which all funds must be obligated, withholding this RFP
:::index 79p25195

to provide for public notice and comment would unduly delay the provision of benefits associated with these broadband initiatives and be contrary to the public interest.</p>

        <p id="p-227" data-page="25195">For the same reasons, the Agency finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness for this action. Because notice and opportunity for comment are not required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) or any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (5 U.S.C. 601 <i>et seq.</i>) are inapplicable. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required and has not been prepared.</p>
