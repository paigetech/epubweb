    <p id="p-3" data-page="75902">The Minnesota Indian Affairs Council has completed an inventory of human remains and associated funerary objects, in consultation with the appropriate Indian tribes, and has determined that there is no cultural affiliation between the human remains and any present-day Indian tribe. Representatives of any Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with the human remains may contact the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council. Disposition of the human remains and associated funerary objects to the Indian tribes stated below may occur if no additional requestors come forward.</p>

<br><p><b>Consultation 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-8" data-page="75902">A detailed assessment of the human remains was made by the MIAC professional staff in consultation with representatives of the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota; Lower Sioux Indian Community in the State of Minnesota; Prairie Island Indian Community in the State of Minnesota; Santee Sioux Nation, Nebraska; Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota; Spirit Lake Tribe, North Dakota; and the Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota (hereinafter referred to as &#x201C;The Tribes&#x201D;).</p>
        
<br><p><b>History and Description of the Remains 
</b></p>

        <p id="p-9" data-page="75902">Between 1994 and 1996, human remains representing, at minimum, 16 individuals were discovered at the Helget site, 21-BW-82, in Brown County, MN, as a result of inadvertent backhoe disturbance on private property by the landowner. The remains were subsequently recovered by the Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist. In 1995 and 1997, the human remains were transferred to the MIAC and assigned case number H291. No known individuals were identified. No associated funerary objects are present.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="75902">The burial context and cranial morphology identify these human remains as pre-contact American Indian. These human remains have no archeological classification and cannot be identified with any present-day Indian tribe.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="75902">In 1958, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were recovered from an undesignated site in Carver County, MN, by Mr. Bleichner while rock collecting in a gravel pit. In 2002, Mr. Bleichner donated the remains to the Carver County Historical Society. The remains were then transferred to the Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist and then to the MIAC (H407). No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="75902">The condition of the human remains suggests they are from a pre-contact time period and femora morphology identifies them as American Indian. These human remains have no archeological classification and cannot be associated with any present-day Indian tribe.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="75902">In 1955 and 1956, human remains representing, at minimum, 15 individuals were recovered from site, 21-DK-5, Bremer Mound in Dakota County, MN, during archeological excavations conducted by Elden Johnson and Louis Powell of the Science Museum of Minnesota. In 1994 and 2010, the human remains were transferred from the Science Museum of Minnesota to the MIAC and assigned case number H259. No known individuals were identified. The two associated funerary objects include a small triangular projectile point and a bone bead.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="75902">Records at the Science Museum of Minnesota, including a M.A. thesis by Peter Jensen (&#x201C;The Bremer Village and Mound Site,&#x201D; 1959) suggest the human remains and associated funerary objects are associated with the Late Woodland Tradition based on the similarity between the objects and artifactual material in the mound fill (ceramic sherds) with material found at the Late Woodland component of a nearby (1/4mile) village site, 21-DK-6. These human remains are associated with the Late Woodland Tradition, an archeological classification which cannot be identified with any present-day Indian tribe.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="75902">In 1990, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were transferred from the Fillmore County Museum to the MIAC&apos;s laboratory at Hamline University where they were assigned case number H175. Information with the transfer indicates the human remains were from a display in a doctor&apos;s office in Fillmore County. No known individual was identified. No associated funerary objects are present.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="75902">The condition and cranial morphology of the human remains identify them as pre-contact American Indian. These human remains have no archeological classification and cannot be associated with any present-day Indian tribe.</p>

        <p id="p-17" data-page="75902">In the 1950s, human remains representing, at minimum, three individuals were recovered by unknown person(s) from an outlet of Albert Lea
