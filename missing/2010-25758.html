          <p id="p-6" data-page="62893">2. <i>Current OMB approval number:</i> 3150-0146.</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="62893">3. <i>How often the collection is required:</i> Annually and on occasion.</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="62893">4. <i>Who is required or asked to report:</i> Nuclear power reactor licensees licensed under 10 CFR Part 50 or 52 (except those who have permanently ceased operations and have verified that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor); all holders of nuclear power plant construction permits and early site permits with a limited work authorization and applicants for nuclear power plant construction permits that have a limited work authorization under the provisions of 10 CFR Part 50; all holders of a combined license for a nuclear power plant issued under 10 CFR Part 52 and applicants for a combined license that have a limited work authorization; all licensee who are authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material (SSNM) under the provisions of 10 CFR Part 70; all holders of a certificate of compliance of an approved compliance plan issued under 10 CFR Part 76, if the holder engages in activities involving formula quantities of SSNM; and all contractor/vendors (C/V) who implement fitness-for-duty (FFD) programs or program elements to the extent that the licensees and other entities listed in this paragraph rely on those C/V FFD programs or program elements to comply with 10 CFR Part 26.</p>

          <p id="p-11" data-page="62893">7. <i>Abstract:</i> NRC regulations in 10 CFR Part 26 prescribe requirements to establish, implement, and maintain fitness-for-duty programs at affected licensees and other entities. The objectives of these requirements are to provide reasonable assurance that persons subject to the rule are trustworthy, reliable, and not under the influence of any substance, legal or illegal, or mentally or physically impaired from any cause, which in any way could adversely affect their ability to safely and competently perform their duties. These requirements also provide reasonable assurance that the effects of fatigue and degraded alertness on individual&apos;s abilities to safely and competently perform their duties are managed commensurate with maintaining public health and safety. The information collections required by Part 26 are necessary to properly manage FFD programs and to enable effective and efficient regulatory oversight of affected licensees other entities. These licensees and other entities must perform certain tasks, maintain records, and submit reports to comply with Part 26 drug and alcohol provisions and fatigue management requirements. These records and reports are necessary to enable regulatory inspection and evaluation of a licensee&apos;s or entity&apos;s compliance with NRC regulations, its FFD performance, and of any significant FFD-related event to help maintain public health and safety, promote the common defense and security, and protect the environment.</p>
