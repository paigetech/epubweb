<br><p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>

          <p id="p-37" data-page="79381">This NPR amends the January 2011 NPR and solicits public comment on proposed methodologies for calculating the specific risk capital requirements for covered debt and securitization positions under the market risk capital rules. Specific risk relates to changes in the market value of a position due to factors other than general market movements. The proposed methodologies would result in specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions that are generally consistent with the BCBS&apos;s market risk framework, which relies on the use of credit ratings. The agencies expect to finalize this proposal, together with the January 2011 NPR, in the coming months after receipt and consideration of comments.</p>
          <br><p><b>A. January 2011 NPR</b></p>
          <p id="p-38" data-page="79381">The January 2011 NPR requested comment on a proposal to implement various revisions to the market risk framework adopted by the BCBS<sup>
        [1]
      </sup>
            between July 2005 and June 2010. The revisions would significantly modify the agencies&apos; market risk capital rules<sup>
        [2]
      </sup>
            to better capture those positions for which application of the market risk capital rules are appropriate, address shortcomings in the modeling of certain risks, address procyclicality concerns, enhance the rules&apos; sensitivity to risks that are not adequately captured under the current regulatory capital measurement methodologies, and increase transparency through enhanced disclosures.<sup>
        [3]
      </sup>
            
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p id="p-42" data-page="79381">The January 2011 NPR was based on the <i>International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework (Basel II or New Accord),</i>
            <sup>
        [4]
      </sup>
            and revisions thereto included in <i>The Application of Basel II to Trading Activities and the Treatment of Double Default Effects,</i> published jointly by the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the BCBS in 2005 (2005 revisions),<sup>
        [5]
      </sup>

            as well as revisions developed by the BCBS and published in three documents in July 2009: <i>Revisions to the Basel II Market Risk Framework,<sup>
        [6]
      </sup>
              Guidelines for Computing Capital for Incremental Risk in the Trading Book,<sup>
        [7]
      </sup>
              and Enhancements to the Basel II Framework</i>
            <sup>
        [8]
      </sup>
            (collectively, the 2009 revisions). In June 2010, the BCBS published additional revisions to the market risk framework that included establishing a floor on the risk-based capital requirement for modeled correlation trading positions.<sup>
        [9]
      </sup>
            
          </p>
          
          
          
          
          
          
          <p id="p-49" data-page="79381">Both the 2005 and 2009 revisions include provisions that reference credit ratings. In particular, the 2005 revisions provide for the use of credit ratings to determine the specific risk add-on for a debt position that is a covered position under the standardized measurement method. The 2005 and 2009 revisions also expand the &#x201C;government&#x201D; category of debt positions to include all sovereign debt and change the specific risk-weighting factor for sovereign debt from zero percent to a range of zero to 12.0 percent based on the credit rating of the obligor and the remaining contractual maturity of the debt position.<sup>
        [10]
      </sup>
            
          </p>
          
          <p id="p-51" data-page="79381">The 2009 revisions include changes to the specific risk-weighting factors for rated and unrated securitization positions. For rated securitization positions, the revisions assign a specific risk-weighting factor based on the credit rating of a position, and whether such rating represents a long-term credit rating or a short-term credit rating. In addition, the 2009 revisions provide for the application of higher specific risk-weighting factors to rated re-securitization positions relative to similarly-rated securitization exposures. Under the 2009 revisions, unrated positions were to be deducted from total capital, except when the unrated position was held by a bank<sup>
        [11]
      </sup>

            that had approval to use the supervisory formula approach to determine the specific risk add-on for the unrated position, when the bank had approval to use an approach that used estimates in line
:::index 76p79382

with the quantitative standards under the advanced approaches rule, or when the bank holding the unrated position elected to use the concentration ratio approach to calculate the specific risk add-on. Under <i>Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems</i> (Basel III), published by the BCBS in December 2010, and revised in June 2011, certain items, including certain securitization positions, that had been deducted from total capital are assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent.</p>
          
          <br><p><b>B. Development of Alternative Methodologies</b></p>
          <p id="p-53" data-page="79382">Section 939A of the Act requires federal agencies to remove from their regulations any reference to or requirement of reliance on credit ratings in the assessment of creditworthiness of a security or money market instrument. Section 939A further requires the agencies to substitute in such regulations a standard of creditworthiness that the agencies determine to be appropriate in consideration of the entities regulated by each such agency and the purposes for which such entities would rely on such standards of creditworthiness.</p>
          <p id="p-54" data-page="79382">In view of the requirements of section 939A, when publishing the January 2011 NPR, the agencies decided not to propose to implement those aspects of the 2005 and 2009 revisions that rely on the use of credit ratings. Instead, the January 2011 NPR included as a placeholder the treatment under the agencies&apos; current market risk capital rules for determining the specific risk add-ons for debt and securitization positions. The agencies acknowledged the shortcomings of the current treatment and recognized that the treatment would need to be amended in accordance with the requirements of section 939A.</p>
          <p id="p-55" data-page="79382">As part of their coordinated effort to implement the requirements of section 939A, on August 25, 2010, the agencies published a joint advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR)<sup>
        [12]
      </sup>
            seeking comment on alternative creditworthiness standards for those provisions of the agencies&apos; risk-based capital rules that currently reference credit ratings. The agencies received 23 comments on the ANPR from banks, industry and consumer advocacy groups, and individuals.</p>
          
          <p id="p-57" data-page="79382">Most commenters shared a general concern regarding the removal of credit ratings from the risk-based capital rules and asserted that credit ratings can be a valuable tool for assessing creditworthiness. These commenters also stated that any alternative creditworthiness standard used for the purposes of the risk-based capital rules should be risk sensitive so as to not incent banks to engage in regulatory arbitrage.</p>
          <p id="p-58" data-page="79382">A number of commenters stated that section 939A permits the use of credit ratings as a supplement to prudent due diligence reviews. Other commenters asserted generally that a legislative change should be enacted that would amend section 939A to permit the agencies to continue using credit ratings in their regulations. These commenters stated that developing a suitable alternative to credit ratings would be impossible without creating undue regulatory burden, which would be particularly acute for community banks. Many commenters expressed concern that a risk-sensitive methodology to replace reliance on credit ratings requiring extensive modeling capabilities would disproportionately burden community and regional banks. According to these commenters, community and regional banks generally do not have the internal systems and staff capable of performing a level of analysis similar to that performed by credit rating agencies, and thus would have to hire third-party vendors.</p>
          <p id="p-59" data-page="79382">Some commenters also stated that any alternative could result in inconsistencies with the international capital standards established by the BCBS that could place U.S. banks at a competitive disadvantage relative to non-U.S. banks. Other commenters stated that exclusive reliance on credit ratings is inappropriate, especially for securitization exposures for which measuring risk requires consideration of specific cash flow structures, collateral, and other enhancements.</p>
          <p id="p-60" data-page="79382">Following the release of the ANPR, on November 10, 2010, the Board hosted a roundtable discussion attended by staff and principals of the agencies, as well as bankers, academics, asset managers, staff of credit rating organizations, and others to discuss alternative measures of creditworthiness. The roundtable participants reiterated many of the concerns expressed by commenters in response to the joint ANPR.<sup>
        [13]
      </sup>
            
          </p>
          
          <br><p><b>C. Objectives of the Proposed Revisions</b></p>
          <p id="p-62" data-page="79382">Since the publication of the ANPR and the January 2011 NPR, the agencies have been working to develop appropriate alternative creditworthiness standards to comply with section 939A of the Act. As indicated in the ANPR, the agencies believe that any alternative creditworthiness standard should, to the extent possible:</p>
          <ul>
<li id="p-63" data-page="79382"> Appropriately distinguish the credit risk associated with a particular exposure within an asset class;</li>
          <li id="p-64" data-page="79382"> Be sufficiently transparent, unbiased, replicable, and defined to allow banking organizations of varying size and complexity to arrive at the same assessment of creditworthiness for similar exposures and to allow for appropriate supervisory review;</li>
          <li id="p-65" data-page="79382"> Provide for the timely and accurate measurement of negative and positive changes in creditworthiness;</li>
          <li id="p-66" data-page="79382"> Minimize opportunities for regulatory capital arbitrage;</li>
          <li id="p-67" data-page="79382"> Be reasonably simple to implement and not add undue burden on banking organizations; and,</li>
          <li id="p-68" data-page="79382"> Foster prudent risk management.</li>
</ul>
          <p id="p-69" data-page="79382">In developing alternative creditworthiness standards in this NPR, the agencies strove to incorporate as many of these features as possible and to establish capital requirements comparable to those published in the 2005 and 2009 revisions to ensure international consistency and competitive equity.</p>
          <p id="p-70" data-page="79382">While this NPR concerns the market risk capital rules, the agencies believe that it is important to align the methodologies for calculating specific risk-weighting factors for debt positions and securitization positions in the market risk capital rules with methodologies for assigning risk weights under the agencies&apos; other capital rules. Such alignment would reduce the potential for regulatory arbitrage between rules. Accordingly, the agencies intend to propose, at a later date, to revise their general risk-based capital rules<sup>
        [14]
      </sup>
            by incorporating creditworthiness standards for debt and securitization positions similar to the standards included in this proposal. Table 1 shows areas in the agencies&apos; current and proposed risk-based capital standards that make reference to credit ratings.</p>

<br><p><b>II. The Proposed Rule 
</b></p>

          <br><p><b>A. Specific Risk Treatment Under the Agencies&apos; Market Risk Capital Rules</b></p>
          <p id="p-72" data-page="79383">Specificrisk relates to changes in the market value of a position due to factors other than general market movements. For example, general market risk arises from changes in the level of interest rates on Treasury securities, from changes in the credit spreads for all borrowers of similar credit quality, and from changes in foreign exchange rates. These general market risk factors affect the value of all positions in a bank&apos;s trading account that are driven by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or equity and commodity prices. In contrast, specific risk refers to factors that apply singularly to an identified position. For example, idiosyncratic credit risk associated with a particular issuer of a debt instrument&#x2014;which makes the holder of that instrument vulnerable to losses due to the credit quality deterioration of the issuer, or its declaration of bankruptcy&#x2014;is specific risk.</p>
          
          <p id="p-74" data-page="79383">Under the market risk capital rules, a bank may use an internal model to measure its exposure to specific risk if it has demonstrated to its primary federal supervisor that the model adequately measures the specific risk of its debt and equity positions. If a bank does not model specific risk, it must calculate its specific risk capital requirement, or &#x201C;add-on&#x201D; using a standardized method.<sup>
        [16]
      </sup>
            Under this method, the specific risk add-on for debt and securitization positions is calculated by multiplying the absolute value of the current market value of each net long and net short position in a debt instrument by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor that is specified in the rule. These specific risk-weighting factors range from zero to 8.0 percent and are based on the identity of the obligor and, in the case of some positions, the credit rating and remaining contractual maturity of the position. The specific risk add-on for a derivative instrument is based on the market value of the effective notional amount of the underlying position. A bank may net long and short debt positions (including derivatives) in identical debt issues or indices. A bank may also offset a &#x201C;matched&#x201D; position in a derivative and its corresponding underlying instrument.</p>
          
          <p id="p-76" data-page="79383">Under the standardized method, the specific risk add-on for equity positions is the sum of the bank&apos;s net long and short positions in an equity position, multiplied by a specific risk-weighting factor. A bank may net long and short positions (including derivatives) in identical equity issues or equity indices in the same market. The specific risk add-on is 8.0 percent of the net equity position, unless the bank&apos;s portfolio is both liquid and well-diversified, in which case the specific risk add-on is 4.0 percent. For positions that are index contracts comprising a well-diversified portfolio of equities, the specific risk add-on is 2.0 percent of the net long or net short position in the index.</p>
          <br><p><b>B. Overview of the Proposed Revisions</b></p>
          <p id="p-77" data-page="79383">This rulemaking sets forth methodologies for calculating specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions under the agencies&apos; proposed market risk capital rule that do not include references to credit ratings. To the extent feasible, the agencies have calibrated the capital requirements produced under these methodologies to be broadly consistent with the capital requirements under the Basel standardized measurement method for specific risk. While it is not possible to fully align these capital requirements without referencing credit ratings, the agencies believe that the capital requirements under the proposed methodologies generally would be comparable to those produced by the BCBS&apos;s standardized measurement method.</p>
          <p id="p-78" data-page="79383">
            <i>Question 1. The agencies recognize that any measure of creditworthiness likely will involve tradeoffs between more refined differentiation of risk and greater implementation burden. Do the proposed revisions described below strike an appropriate balance between measurement of risk and implementation burden in considering alternative measures of creditworthiness? Are there other alternatives permissible under section 939A of the Act that strike a more appropriate balance?</i>
          </p>
          <p id="p-79" data-page="79383">Together with the new specific risk capital requirements, the agencies have included in this proposal a number of definitions relevant to the specific risk requirements proposed in this NPR.</p>
          <br><p><b>1. Sovereign Debt Positions</b></p>
          <br><p><b>Background</b></p>

          <p id="p-80" data-page="79383">The specific risk-weighting factors for sovereign debt positions in the current market risk capital rules are based on the membership of the sovereign entity in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Covered debt positions that are exposures to sovereign entities that are OECD members receive a zero percent specific risk-weighting factor, whereas exposures to sovereign entities that are non-OECD members receive an 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor. The general risk-based capital rules assign risk weights to credit exposures using the same OECD/non-OECD distinction. Under the 2005 revisions, sovereign positions would be assigned specific risk-weighting factors based on a given sovereign&apos;s external credit rating.

          <br><p><b>Proposed Approach to Sovereign Debt Positions</b></p>
          <p id="p-82" data-page="79384">Under this NPR, &#x201C;sovereign debt position&#x201D; would be defined as a direct exposure to a sovereign entity. Consistent with the January 2011 proposal, sovereign entity is defined as a central government or an agency, department, ministry, or central bank of a central government. A sovereign entity would not include commercial enterprises owned by the central government that are engaged in activities involving trade, commerce, or profit, which are generally conducted or performed in the private sector.</p>
          <p id="p-83" data-page="79384">The agencies are proposing that a bank determine its specific risk-weighting factors for sovereign debt positions based on OECD Country Risk Classifications (CRCs).<sup>
        [17]
      </sup>
            The OECD&apos;s CRCs are used for transactions covered by the OECD arrangement on export credits in order to provide a basis under the arrangement for participating countries to calculate the premium interest rate to be charged to cover the risk of non-repayment of export credits.</p>
          
          <p id="p-85" data-page="79384">The agencies believe that use of CRCs in the proposal is permissible under section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 939A is part of Subtitle C of Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, enhances regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of credit rating agencies, including Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs) registered with the SEC, and removes references to credit ratings and NRSROs from federal statutes. In the introductory &#x201C;findings&#x201D; section to Subtitle C, which is entitled &#x201C;Improvements to the Regulation of Credit Ratings Agencies,&#x201D; Congress characterized credit rating agencies as organizations that play a critical &#x201C;gatekeeper&#x201D; role in the debt markets and perform evaluative and analytical services on behalf of clients, and whose activities are fundamentally commercial in character.<sup>
        [18]
      </sup>
            Furthermore, the legislative history of section 939A focuses on the conflicts of interest of credit rating agencies in providing credit ratings to their clients, and the problem of government &#x201C;sanctioning&#x201D; of the credit rating agencies&apos; credit ratings by having them incorporated into federal regulation.</p>
          
          <p id="p-87" data-page="79384">The agencies believe that section 939A was not intended to apply to assessments of creditworthiness of organizations such as the OECD. The OECD is not subject to the sorts of conflicts of interest that affected NRSROs because the OECD is not a commercial entity that produces credit assessments for fee-paying clients, nor does it provide the sort of evaluative and analytical services as credit rating agencies. Additionally, the agencies note that the use of the CRCs is limited in the proposal and that the agencies are considering additional measures that could supplement the CRCs to determine risk-weighting factors for sovereign debt positions.</p>
          <p id="p-88" data-page="79384">
            <i>Question 2: The agencies solicit comment on the use of the CRC ratings to assign specific risk-weighting factors to sovereign debt positions.</i>
          </p>
          <p id="p-89" data-page="79384">The CRC methodology is used by the OECD to assess country credit risk. CRCs are produced generally for the purpose of setting minimum premium rates for transactions covered by the OECD&apos;s Export Credit Arrangement. The CRC methodology was established in 1999 and classifies countries into categories based on the application of two basic components: the country risk assessment model (CRAM), which is an econometric model that produces a quantitative assessment of country credit risk; and the qualitative assessment of the CRAM results, which integrates political risk and other risk factors not fully captured by the CRAM. The two components of the CRC methodology are combined and result in countries being classified into one of eight risk categories (0-7), with countries assigned to the 0 category having the lowest possible risk assessment and countries assigned to the 7 category having the highest.</p>
          <p id="p-90" data-page="79384">The agencies consider CRCs to be a reasonable alternative to credit ratings and to be more granular than the current treatment based on OECD membership. The OECD regularly updates CRCs for over 150 countries. Also, CRCs are recognized by the BCBS as an alternative to credit ratings.<sup>
        [19]
      </sup>
            
          </p>
          
          <p id="p-92" data-page="79384">However, the agencies recognize that CRCs have certain limitations. While the OECD has published a general description of the methodology for CRC determinations, the methodology is largely principles-based and does not provide details regarding the specific information and data considered to support a CRC. Also, OECD-member sovereigns that are defined to be &#x201C;high-income countries&#x201D; by the World Bank are assigned a CRC of zero, the  most favorable classification.<sup>
        [20]
      </sup>

            As such, a CRC classification may not accurately reflect a high income OECD country&apos;s relative risk of default. Additionally, while the OECD reviews qualitative
:::index 76p79385

factors for each sovereign on a monthly basis, quantitative financial and economic information used to assign CRCs is available only annually in some cases, and payment performance is updated quarterly. The agencies are concerned that, in some cases, the CRC may misclassify risks for purposes of assessing risk-based capital requirements, particularly where sovereign debt restructuring has occurred. In such cases, the CRC appears to assess the risk associated with the sovereign&apos;s payment of the restructured debt and may not fully reflect the credit event associated with the restructuring.</p>
          
          <p id="p-94" data-page="79385">To alleviate concerns about potential misclassifications, the agencies are proposing to apply a specific risk-weighting factor of 12.0 percent to sovereign debt positions where the sovereign has defaulted on any exposure during the previous five years. The proposed rule would define a default by a sovereign as noncompliance by a sovereign entity with its external debt service obligations or the inability or unwillingness of a sovereign entity to service an existing obligation according to its terms, as evidenced by failure to make full and timely payments of principal and interest, arrearages, or restructuring. A default would include a voluntary or involuntary restructuring that results in a sovereign entity not servicing an existing obligation in accordance with the obligation&apos;s original terms.</p>
          <p id="p-95" data-page="79385">For purposes of the proposed rule, the agencies assigned specific risk-weighting factors to CRCs in a manner consistent with the assignment of risk weights to CRCs under the Basel II standardized framework, as set forth in table 3.</p>

          <p id="p-97" data-page="79385">As under the general risk-based capital rules, a bank may assign to a sovereign debt position a specific risk-weighting factor that is lower than the applicable specific risk-weighting factor in Table 4 if the position is denominated in the sovereign entity&apos;s currency, the bank has at least an equivalent amount of liabilities in that currency, and the sovereign entity allows banks under its jurisdiction to assign the lower specific risk-weighting factor to the same position.</p>
          <p id="p-98" data-page="79385">The agencies have included exceptions to this general approach. For instance, sovereign debt positions that are exposures to the United States government and its agencies always would be treated as having a CRC of zero, and sovereign debt positions of sovereign entities that have no CRC generally would be assigned an 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor.</p>
          <br><p><b>Alternative Market-based Approaches for Sovereign Debt Positions</b></p>
          <p id="p-99" data-page="79385">In developing the proposed rule, the agencies considered a range of financial and market-based alternatives to the use of credit ratings, either as a replacement for or to supplement the use of CRCs. Two possible market-based indicators are sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads, or bond spreads. Both of these market-based indicators could be more &#x201C;forward looking&#x201D; than indicators based on historical information, and, under such an approach, banks would assign specific risk-weighting factors based on whether the CRC or the spread methodology indicated a higher capital requirement. Use of these market-based indicators along with CRCs could also improve overall accuracy in assignment of specific risk-weighting factors, especially for certain high-income OECD countries.</p>

          <p id="p-100" data-page="79385">Credit default swap spreads for a given sovereign could be used to assign specific risk-weighting factors, with higher CDS spreads resulting in assignments of higher specific risk-weighting factors. The presumption is that CDS spreads will reflect market perception of a sovereign&apos;s default risk. To make such an approach practicable, the agencies would need to implement a methodology that mitigates concerns regarding volatility and information content of CDS spreads. For instance, the agencies could require use of five-year CDS premiums, which are the most liquid contracts traded and are generally considered the most widely-recognized benchmark in this context. To limit volatility concerns, the CDS spread could be calculated as a one-year, rolling daily average of a sovereign&apos;s CDS premium. To focus on country-specific levels of risk premiums, the agencies could subtract a designated
:::index 76p79386

base rate, for example, 50 basis points, which is based on the long-term historical average of United States CDS spreads. Table 5 illustrates how CDS spreads and CRCs could be used together to assign specific risk-weighting factors. In order to have an approach that uses CDS spreads and CRCs, a position&apos;s specific risk-weighting factor would be based on the higher of the specific risk-weighting factors required by the sovereign&apos;s CRC rating and its CDS spread from table 5. To illustrate this approach, assume a sovereign is assigned a zero CRC rating and the one year average of the five-year CDS spread of the sovereign is 150 basis points above the base rate. Since the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to the CDS spread is higher than the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to the CRC rating, the applicable risk-weighting factor for positions that are exposures to that sovereign would be based on the CDS spread, or 4.0 percent.</p>

          <p id="p-101" data-page="79386">Sovereign bond spreads could also be used to assign specific risk-weighting factors, with higher bond credit spreads for a given sovereign resulting in higher risk specific risk-weighting factors, similar to the methodology described above for CDS spreads. As with CDS spreads, the presumption is that sovereign bond credit spreads reflect market expectations of default risk. However, in order to use bond credit spreads, the agencies would need to address certain challenges. For example, sovereign bonds usually are denominated in the currency of the country of issuance and spreads that are calculated from sovereign bond yields in different currencies would reflect factors other than credit risk, such as the sovereign&apos;s inflation rate and its currency&apos;s exchange rate with other currencies. Therefore, it would be difficult to determine what portion of a sovereign&apos;s total bond spread reflects credit risk. As a result, it also would be difficult to compare the relative likelihood of default among sovereign debt positions.</p>
          <p id="p-102" data-page="79386">A possible solution could be to use only bonds denominated in U.S. dollars, and perhaps one or two other major currencies as base currencies. Under such an approach, a &#x201C;base&#x201D; obligation with relatively low credit risk (in the case of U.S. dollar-denominated notes, a U.S. Treasury bond) would be identified and the spread between that obligation and that of bonds issued by other sovereign entities in the same currency with similar remaining maturity would be used to assign the specific risk-weighting factor. A similar process could be used for bonds denominated in euros, with the issuance of a particular sovereign entity deemed low credit risk based on a certain period of market history providing the &#x201C;base&#x201D; rate to which other euro-denominated bonds of similar remaining maturity would be compared in order to determine the specific risk-weighting factor for those obligations.</p>
          <p id="p-103" data-page="79386">Such an approach may be limited in scope as many sovereign entities either do not issue bonds in currencies other than their own, or issue very small amounts. For instance, approximately 70 countries have some U.S. dollar-denominated debt outstanding, but such issuances are usually infrequent and small in dollar volume. Issuances of euro- and yen-denominated bonds are much less frequent than those of dollar-denominated bonds.

          <p id="p-105" data-page="79386">Under the agencies&apos; current market risk capital rules, debt positions that are exposures to certain supranational entities and multilateral development banks (MDBs) receive specific risk-weighting factors that range between 0.25 percent and 1.6 percent, depending on their remaining maturity. Under the Basel market risk framework, as revised, these positions continue to receive the same treatment as in the agencies&apos; current market risk capital rules.</p>
          <p id="p-106" data-page="79386">The proposed rule defines an MDB to include the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the International Finance Corporation, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the Nordic Investment Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the Council of Europe Development Bank, and any other multilateral lending institution or regional development bank in which the U.S. government is a shareholder or contributing member or which the bank&apos;s primary federal supervisor determines poses comparable credit risk.</p>
          <p id="p-107" data-page="79386">Consistent with the treatment of exposures to supranational entities under the New Accord, the agencies are proposing to assign a zero percent specific risk-weighting factor to debt positions that are exposures to the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund.</p>

          <p id="p-108" data-page="79386">Generally consistent with the Basel framework, the agencies also are proposing to apply a zero percent specific risk-weighting factor to debt positions that are exposures to MDBs, as defined in the proposed rule. This treatment is based on these MDBs&apos; generally high-credit quality, strong shareholder support, and a shareholder structure comprised of a significant proportion of sovereign entities with strong creditworthiness.

            are assigned specific risk-weighting factors ranging from 0.25 percent to 1.6 percent, depending on maturity. For the purposes of this proposal, a GSE would be defined as an agency or corporation originally established or chartered by the U.S. Government to serve public purposes specified by the U.S. Congress, but whose obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. In this proposal, and consistent with the treatment of these positions in the current market risk capital rules, the agencies propose to apply specific risk-weighting factors ranging from 0.25 percent to 1.6 percent to debt positions that are exposures to GSEs based on the remaining maturity of the position. GSE equity exposures, including preferred stock, would be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 8.0 percent.</p>

          <p id="p-112" data-page="79387">Under the current market risk capital rules, debt positions that are exposures to banks incorporated in OECD countries generally are assigned a specific risk-weighting factor ranging from 0.25 percent to 1.6 percent based on remaining maturity of the position. Banks that are not incorporated in an OECD country are assigned similar specific risk-weighting factors if certain conditions are met, including the presence of an investment-grade rating from a credit rating agency or assessments of comparable credit quality by the investing bank. Higher specific risk-weighting factors are assigned to positions that are rated below investment grade or deemed to be of comparable credit quality. The Basel market risk framework also makes use of credit ratings to assign specific risk-weighting factors to these positions.</p>
          <p id="p-113" data-page="79387">This proposal would eliminate the distinction based on OECD membership for the purpose of the market risk capital rules and instead apply specific risk-weighting factors to debt positions that are exposures to depository institutions,<sup>

        [23]
      </sup>
            based on the applicable specific risk-weighting factor of the entity&apos;s sovereign of incorporation, as shown in Table 6. For example, debt positions that are exposure to a bank incorporated in a country with a CRC of 1 would be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor ranging from 0.25 percent to 1.6 percent depending on the remaining maturity of the position. For purposes of this proposal, sovereign of incorporation means the country where an entity is incorporated, chartered, or similarly established. If an entity&apos;s sovereign of incorporation is assigned to the 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor because of a lack of CRC rating, then the debt position that is an exposure to that entity would also be assigned an 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor.</p>

            Positions that are revenue obligations of states and other political subdivisions of OECD countries are treated in the same manner if certain conditions are met.

governmental subdivision below the level of a sovereign entity. This definition does not include commercial companies owned by a government that engage in activities involving trade, commerce, or profit, which are generally conducted or performed in the private sector. The agencies propose that the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a debt position that is an exposure to a PSE be based on the CRC assigned to the country of incorporation of the PSE, as well as whether the position is a general obligation or a revenue obligation of the PSE. This methodology is similar to the approach under the Basel II standardized approach for credit risk, which allows a bank to assign a risk weight to PSEs based on the credit rating of the sovereign of incorporation of the PSE.</p>
          <p id="p-122" data-page="79388">A general obligation is defined as a bond or similar obligation that is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of states or other political subdivisions of a sovereign entity. Revenue obligation is defined as a bond or similar obligation that is an obligation of a state or other political subdivision of a sovereign entity, but which the government entity is committed to repay with revenues from a specific project financed rather than with general tax funds.</p>
          <p id="p-123" data-page="79388">For example, two debt positions with a remaining maturity exceeding 24 months that are exposures to the same PSE&#x2014;one a general obligation and the other a revenue obligation&#x2014;would be assigned different specific risk-weighting factors as follows: if the sovereign of incorporation has a CRC of 2, the general obligation debt position would receive a 1.6 percent specific risk-weighting factor, and the revenue obligation debt position would receive a 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor. If a PSE&apos;s sovereign of incorporation was assigned to the 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor due to a lack of a CRC, then a debt position that is an exposure to that PSE also would be assigned an 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor.</p>
          <p id="p-124" data-page="79388">The specific risk-weighting factors for debt positions that are general obligations and revenue obligations of PSEs, based on the PSE&apos;s country of incorporation, are shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.</p>

          <p id="p-131" data-page="79389">In this NPR, the agencies propose to permit a bank to use a methodology that uses market-based information and historical accounting information (indicator-based methodology) to assign specific risk-weighting factors to corporate debt positions that are exposures to a publicly-traded entity that is not a financial institution, and to assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 8.0 percent to all other corporate debt positions excluding those that are exposures to a depository institution, foreign bank, or credit union, which are addressed above. The agencies propose to categorize financial institutions separately from other entities because of the differences in their balance sheet structures. As a simple alternative, a bank may assign an 8.0 percent specific risk-weighting factor to all of its corporate debt positions.</p>

          <p id="p-148" data-page="79390">To use the proposed indicator-based methodology, a bank must calculate the following: (1) Leverage, measured by the ratio of total liabilities (DEBT) to the market value of assets (A); (2) cash flow, measured as the ratio of earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to a market value of assets; and (3) monthly stock return volatility (VOL). In order to assign a corporate debt position a specific risk-weighting factor using the indicator-based methodology, a bank would be required to use publicly available financial data to calculate a value for each of the three indicators. Separate calculations would be made for each quarterly regulatory financial report. The calculation of debt would be based on liabilities reported as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter. Assets would be measured as the sum of the product of the number of outstanding shares as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter multiplied by the entity&apos;s stock price on the last trading day of the most recent calendar quarter plus the measure of liabilities reported as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter. To calculate EBITDA for the three-indicator methodology, a bank would use EBITDA for the four most recent calendar quarters. The EBITDA-to-assets ratio would be calculated by dividing an entity&apos;s cumulative EBITDA over the previous four quarters by its equity market value plus total liabilities as reported as of the end of the most recent quarter. So, for example, when measuring EBITDA on March 31, 2012, the bank likely would use EBITDA for the period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2011. Stock return volatility would be measured as the standard deviation of the corporate obligor&apos;s monthly stock return as of the last trading day of each month over the immediate preceding 12 months. So, for example, stock return volatility measured as of March 31, 2012, would be based on the entity&apos;s stock returns calculated using prices as of the last trading day of the months of March 2011 to March 2012, adjusted for stock splits.</p>
          <p id="p-149" data-page="79390">After calculating the three indicators, a bank would assign the debt position that is an exposure to a publicly traded, non-financial institution to a specific risk-weighting factor using table 11. Similar to the current market risk capital rules and the 2005 revisions, certain high-credit-quality debt positions would be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor based on the residual maturity of the debt as shown in tables 11 and 11A.</p>

          <p id="p-150" data-page="79391">These three indicators represent market-based information and historical accounting data found in both industry practice and academic literature for estimating the likelihood of default. In calibrating specific risk-weighting factors using these three indicators, the agencies tried to balance the trade-offs between enhanced risk sensitivity and relative simplicity and ease of use. The three indicators chosen were found to yield relatively comparable results in terms of credit risk differentiation to alternative approaches the agencies considered that incorporate more indicators, including the Altman Z Score approach.<sup>

          <p id="p-159" data-page="79391">Each of these alternatives was viewed as either having significant drawbacks or as not being sufficiently developed to propose them within this NPR. In evaluating whether to propose a multi-indicator methodology to distinguish risk for financial institutions, the agencies note that many financial ratios (such as debt-to-equity) vary significantly among financial industry sub-sectors, such as insurance companies, brokerage firms, and finance companies. Therefore, a ratio-based methodology for all financial institutions might not be feasible for comparing relative risk.</p>
          <p id="p-160" data-page="79391">Given the concerns above, the agencies are proposing that all corporate debt positions issued by financial institutions be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 8.0 percent. The agencies intend to continue working to develop and evaluate alternative methodologies to the use of credit ratings for financial institution debt positions.</p>
          <br><p><b>Alternative Approach&#x2014;Bond Spreads</b></p>

          <p id="p-161" data-page="79391">The agencies considered using bond spreads as an alternative to using credit ratings for assigning capital requirements to both financial and non-financial corporate debt positions. Similar to the three-indicator methodology, an approach that uses bond credit spreads would be market-based and forward-looking. Unlike the three-indicator approach, however, a bond spread approach could be particularly useful for assigning specific risk-weighting factors to financial institutions since, as noted earlier, many
:::index 76p79392

financial ratios (such as debt-to-equity) vary significantly between financial industry sub-sectors, and therefore are not necessarily useful for comparing relative risk. However, because bond markets can sometimes misprice risk and reflect factors other than credit risk, the specific risk-weighting factors determined by this approach may not always be reliable. Additionally, because bond spreads can vary a great deal over short time periods, this approach may introduce undue volatility into the risk-based capital requirements.</p>
          <p id="p-162" data-page="79392">To implement a bond spread-based approach, the agencies could assign corporate debt positions to the same general categories of &#x201C;high risk,&#x201D; &#x201C;medium risk,&#x201D; or &#x201C;low risk,&#x201D; depending on whether the spread on the particular position is priced above or below certain market-based thresholds. Specifically, one could compare the one-year average of the spreads of a financial institution&apos;s closest to five-year, senior unsecured bond, to the one-year averages of two credit default swap indices, such as the five year CDX.NA.IG.FIN index<sup>
        [32]
      </sup>
            and the five-year CDX.NA.HY.B index.<sup>
        [33]
      </sup>

            This methodology could mitigate some of the concerns mentioned above, by explicitly evaluating risk on a <i>relative</i> basis and smoothing volatility by using one-year averages.</p>
          
          
          <p id="p-165" data-page="79392">Specific risk-weighing factors could then be assigned to corporate debt positions that are exposures to public companies that are financial institutions as shown in Table 12:</p>

          <p id="p-171" data-page="79392">The agencies also are considering whether to permit banks to determine a specific risk-weighting factor for corporate debt positions based on whether the position is &#x201C;investment grade,&#x201D; as that term is defined in the OCC&apos;s regulations at 12 CFR 1.2(d). Under such an approach, an investment grade exposure might be assigned a risk-weighting factor of 6.0 percent and a non-investment grade exposure might be assigned a risk-weighting factor of 12.0 percent.</p>

          <p id="p-172" data-page="79392">The OCC&apos;s investment securities regulations generally require a bank to determine whether or not a security is &#x201C;investment grade&#x201D; in order to determine whether purchasing the security is permissible. The OCC&apos;s investment securities regulations at 12 CFR part 1 use credit ratings as a factor for determining the credit quality, marketability, and appropriate concentration levels of investment securities purchased and held by national banks. Under the OCC rules, an investment security must not be &#x201C;predominantly speculative in nature.&#x201D; The OCC rules provide that an obligation is not &#x201C;predominantly speculative in nature&#x201D; if it is rated investment grade or, if unrated, it is the credit equivalent of investment grade. &#x201C;Investment grade,&#x201D; in turn, is defined as a security rated in one of the four highest rating categories by two or more national recognized statistical rating organization (NRSROs)&#x2014;or one NRSRO

          <p id="p-174" data-page="79393">Under the OCC&apos;s recently proposed revisions to its investment securities regulations, a security would be &#x201C;investment grade&#x201D; if the issuer of the security has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the security.<sup>
        [36]
      </sup>
            The &#x201C;adequate capacity to meet financial commitments&#x201D; standard would replace language in 12 CFR 1.2 which currently references NRSRO credit ratings. To meet this new standard, national banks would have to determine that the risk of default by the obligor is low and the full and timely repayment of principal and interest is expected.</p>
          
          <p id="p-176" data-page="79393">When determining whether a particular issuer has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments under a security for the projected life of the security, the OCC would expect national banks to consider a number of factors, to the extent appropriate. These may include consideration of internal analyses, third-party research and analytics including external credit ratings, internal risk ratings, default statistics, and other sources of information as appropriate for the particular security. Additionally, when purchasing a corporate debt security, a bank would be expected to be able to confirm that the credit spread to U.S. Treasuries is consistent with bonds of similar credit quality; confirm that the risk of default is low and consistent with bonds of similar credit quality; and show that it understands local demographics and economics relevant to the performance of the obligor.</p>
          <p id="p-177" data-page="79393">While external credit ratings and assessments would remain a valuable source of information and provide national banks with a standardized credit risk indicator, banks would have to supplement the credit ratings with due diligence processes and analyses that are appropriate for the bank&apos;s risk profile and for the amount and complexity of the debt instrument. Therefore, it would be possible that a security rated in the top four rating categories by a credit rating agency may not satisfy the proposed revised investment grade standard.</p>
          <p id="p-178" data-page="79393">The agencies believe such an approach would be consistent with current practices and therefore relatively simple for banks to implement. Additionally, banks would be able to apply it to corporate debt securities issued by both financial and non-financial institutions. However, this approach has limited granularity.</p>

          <p id="p-180" data-page="79393">Under the current market risk capital rules, if a bank does not model specific risk, it must calculate a specific risk capital add-on for each securitization position subject to the rule using a standardized method. Under the standardized method, a bank must multiply the absolute value of the current market value of each net long and net short position in a securitization position by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor specified in the rule. These specific risk-weighting factors range from zero to 8.0 percent and are based on the credit rating and remaining contractual maturity of the position. In addition, banks must apply the highest specific risk-weighting factor (8.0 percent) to unrated securitization positions.</p>

          <p id="p-182" data-page="79394">In this proposal, a securitization generally means a transaction in which (1) all or a portion of the credit risk of one or more underlying exposures is transferred to one or more third parties; (2) the credit risk associated with the underlying exposures has been separated into at least two tranches that reflect different levels of seniority; (3) performance of the securitization position depends upon the performance of the underlying exposures; (4) all or substantially all of the underlying exposures are financial exposures (such as loans, commitments, credit derivatives, guarantees, receivables, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, other debt securities, or equity securities); (5) for non-synthetic securitizations, the underlying exposures are not owned by an operating company; (6) the underlying exposures are not owned by a small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 682); and (7) the underlying exposures are not owned by a firm, an investment in which qualifies as a community development investment under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Eleventh). A re-securitization means a securitization in which one or more of the underlying exposures is a securitization position. Securitization position means a covered position that is an on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet credit exposure (including credit-enhancing representations and warranties) that arises from a securitization (including a re-securitization); or an exposure that directly or indirectly references a securitization exposure. A re-securitization position means a covered position that is an on- or off-balance sheet exposure to a re-securitization; or an exposure that directly or indirectly references a re-securitization exposure.</p>
          <p id="p-183" data-page="79394">Under the proposed rule, the agencies have developed a simplified version of the Basel II advanced approaches supervisory formula approach (SFA) to assign specific risk-weighting factors to securitization positions including re-securitization positions. In this proposal, the simplified version is referred to as the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA). If a bank cannot, or chooses not to, use the SSFA, a securitization position would be subject to a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent, which is roughly the equivalent of a 1,250 percent risk weight.</p>
          <p id="p-184" data-page="79394">Similar to the SFA, the SSFA is based on the capital requirements that would be applied to all exposures underlying a securitization.<sup>
        [37]
      </sup>
            A bank would need several inputs to calculate the SSFA. The first input is the weighted-average capital requirement under the general risk-based capital rules that would be assigned to the underlying exposures, if those exposures were held directly by the bank. The second and third inputs indicate the position&apos;s level of subordination and relative size within the securitization. The fourth input is the level of losses actually experienced on the underlying exposures.</p>
          
          <p id="p-186" data-page="79394">The SSFA is designed to apply relatively higher capital requirements to the more risky junior tranches of a securitization that are the first to absorb losses and relatively lower requirements to the most senior positions. The SSFA applies a 100 percent specific risk-weighting factor (roughly equivalent to a 1,250 percent risk weight) to securitization positions that absorb losses up to the amount of capital that would be required for the underlying exposures under the agencies&apos; general risk-based capital rules had those exposures been held directly by a bank. For example, assume a securitization position that is backed by a $100 pool of auto loans is subject to a 100 percent risk weight under the agencies&apos; general risk-based capital rules. Application of a 100 percent risk weight to the $100 pool of loans would result in a total risk-based capital requirement of $8. Therefore, under the SSFA, securitization positions that would absorb up to the first $8 of loss in the securitization would be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent. For the remaining securitization tranches in this example that absorb losses beyond the first $8, the SSFA would apply capital requirements that would decrease as the seniority of the positions increases, subject to the supervisory floor, as described below.</p>
          <p id="p-187" data-page="79394">Apart from the floor and other supervisory adjustments, the SSFA attempts to be as consistent as possible with the general risk-based capital rules that would apply if the underlying exposures were held directly by a bank. At the inception of a securitization, the SSFA would require more capital on a transaction-wide basis than would be required if the pool of assets had not been securitized. That is, if the bank held every tranche of a securitization, its overall capital charge would be greater than if the bank held the underlying assets in portfolios. The agencies believe that this effect would reduce the ability of banks to engage in regulatory capital arbitrage through the use of securitization. However, as discussed in more detail below, the agencies are seeking comment on whether it would be appropriate to make other adjustments to the SSFA that would either increase or decrease the overall capital requirements that would be produced using the SSFA.</p>
          <p id="p-188" data-page="79394">Under the proposed rule, the SSFA specific risk-weighting factor for a position depends on the following inputs:</p>
          <p id="p-189" data-page="79394">(i) K <sub>G</sub> is the weighted-average capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using the agencies&apos; general risk-based capital rules.</p>

          <p id="p-190" data-page="79394">(ii) Parameter A is the attachment point of the position. This represents the threshold at which credit losses would first be allocated to the position. This input is the ratio, expressed as a decimal value between zero and one, of the dollar amount of the securitization positions that are subordinated to the position to the dollar amount of the entire pool of underlying assets.
:::index 76p79395


          </p>

          <p id="p-191" data-page="79395">(iii) Parameter D is the detachment point of the position. This represents the threshold at which credit losses allocated to the position would result in a total loss to the investor in the position. This input, which is a decimal value between zero and one, equals the value of Parameter A plus the ratio of (1) the dollar amount of the positions and all <i>pari passu</i> positions to (2) the dollar amount of the underlying exposures.</p>
          <p id="p-192" data-page="79395">(iv) A supervisory calibration parameter, p. For securitization positions that are not re-securitization positions, this input is 0.5; for re-securitization positions, it is 1.5.</p>
          <p id="p-193" data-page="79395">(v) Cumulative losses on the underlying pool of exposures, which affects the level of the specific risk-weighting factor floor, as discussed below.</p>

          <p id="p-194" data-page="79395">A bank may use the SSFA to determine its specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position only if it has information to assign each of the parameters for the position. In particular, if the bank does not know K <sub>G</sub> for a position because it lacks the necessary information on the underlying exposures, the bank may not use the SSFA to determine its specific risk-weighting factor. Rather, the bank must apply a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent. The agencies believe that for most securitizations, the inputs to the SSFA are readily available from prospectuses for newly-issued securitizations and from servicer reports for existing securitizations.</p>

          <p id="p-200" data-page="79395">The agencies are proposing to apply a specific risk-weight factor floor that will increase as cumulative losses on the pool increase over time (see Table 15). This feature will enhance the risk sensitivity of the capital requirements for securitization positions by increasing the capital requirements for securitization exposures&#x2014;particularly more senior tranches&#x2014;as underlying pool quality exhibits credit deterioration. Under the agencies&apos; current market risk capital rules, many senior securitization positions require limited amounts of capital, even if their external ratings are substantially downgraded. During the crisis, a number of highly rated senior securitization positions were subject to significant downgrades and suffered substantial losses. As indicated in the January 2011 NPR, the agencies are seeking to ensure that sufficient capital is held against such positions and that the amount of required capital is consistent with international agreements.</p>

          <p id="p-204" data-page="79396">The proposed rule specifies the following treatment for the determination of the total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of modeled correlation trading positions and for non-modeled securitization positions. For purposes of a bank calculating its comprehensive risk measure with respect to either the surcharge or floor calculation for a portfolio of correlation trading positions modeled under section 9 of the January 2011 NPR, the total specific risk add-on would be the greater of: (1) The sum of the bank&apos;s specific risk add-ons for each net long correlation trading position calculated using the standardized measurement method; or (2) the sum of the bank&apos;s specific risk add-ons for each net short correlation trading position calculated using the standardized measurement method.</p>
          <p id="p-205" data-page="79396">For a bank&apos;s securitization positions that are not correlation trading positions and for securitization positions that are correlation trading positions not modeled under section 9 of the January 2011 NPR, the total specific risk add-on would be the greater of: (1) The sum of the bank&apos;s specific risk add-ons for each net long securitization position calculated using the standardized measurement method; or (2) the sum of the bank&apos;s specific risk add-ons for each net short securitization position calculated using the standardized measurement method.</p>
          <p id="p-206" data-page="79396">This treatment is consistent with the BCBS&apos;s revisions to the market risk framework. With respect to securitization positions that are not correlation trading positions, the BCBS&apos;s June 2010 revisions provided a transitional period for this treatment. Thus, the agencies anticipate potential reconsideration of this provision at a future date.</p>
          <br><p><b>Alternative Calibrations</b></p>

          <p id="p-207" data-page="79396">Under certain circumstances, the SSFA may produce a specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position that exceeds the specific risk-weighting factor that would otherwise be generated by the Basel market risk framework&apos;s ratings-based approach. For example, certain junior and mezzanine tranches of residential mortgage, credit card, or automobile loan securitization positions may attract a 100 percent specific risk-weighting factor under the SSFA while, depending upon the tranches&apos; credit ratings, the ratings-based approach could assign significantly lower capital requirements. This occurs because the SSFA relies on: (1) The risk weight that would be assigned to the underlying exposures under the general risk-based capital rules, were the exposures held on the bank&apos;s balance sheet; and, (2) the particular position&apos;s attachment and detachment points. The SSFA does not take into consideration many forms of credit enhancements, such as excess spread, that may be recognized by credit rating agencies when assigning credit ratings. As such, the SSFA will result in a 100 percent specific risk-weighting factor for all securitization positions that detach at or below K <sub>G</sub>.</p>

          <p id="p-208" data-page="79396">To better align the specific risk-weighting factors generated by the SSFA with those from the ratings-based approach, the agencies could alter certain parameters in the SSFA. For example, for an automobile securitization, the risk weight generally applicable to the underlying exposures is 100 percent. Therefore, the SSFA assigns a 100 percent specific risk-weighting factor to securitization positions that detach at or below an 8 percent K <sub>G</sub>. However, many automobile securitizations include credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization, and excess spread that would not be recognized under the SSFA.</p>

          <p id="p-209" data-page="79396">To adjust for the lack of recognition of certain forms of credit enhancement, the agencies could introduce a scaling factor to adjust the SSFA based on the type or quality of assets underlying a securitization. The introduction of such a scaling factor could reduce the overall impact of the 100 percent specific risk-weighting factors for securitization positions that detach at or below an 8 percent K <sub>G</sub>. For example, the agencies could scale K <sub>G</sub> by 50 percent so that the 100 percent specific risk-weighting factor for such positions would be applied to the first 4 percent (0.5 * 8 percent = 4 percent) of the securitization structure rather than the 8 percent value in the example above.</p>
          <p id="p-210" data-page="79396">More generally, establishing and adjusting the scaling factor would affect the overall amount of capital required by the SSFA on a transaction-wide basis across the tranches of a securitization. Lower values would correspond to a lower aggregate capital requirement and higher values to a higher aggregate requirement.</p>
          <p id="p-211" data-page="79396">
            <i>Question 12: Is the SSFA function appropriately calibrated and would it be a feasible and appropriate methodology for assigning specific risk add-ons for securitization positions?

          <p id="p-213" data-page="79396">The 2009 revisions incorporate several alternatives for assigning specific risk-weighting factors to unrated securitization positions. For example, for securitization positions that do not meet the requirements for

The concentration ratio equals the sum of the notional amounts of all tranches in the securitization divided by the sum of the notional amounts of the tranches junior to or <i>pari passu</i> with the tranche in which the position is held, including the amount of that tranche itself. If the concentration ratio is 12.5 or higher, the bank would have to apply a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the securitization position.</p>
          <p id="p-214" data-page="79397">The agencies are considering whether to use the concentration ratio in place of, or as a complement to, the SSFA. Like the SSFA, the concentration ratio relies on the calculation of the dollar-weighted average risk weight applicable to the underlying exposures in a securitization position. As such, the agencies believe that the specific risk-weighting factor for securitization positions could be easily calculated using the concentration ratio.</p>

          <p id="p-217" data-page="79397">Another alternative for determining the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization could include the use of market data. Such a methodology could set and adjust the specific risk-weighting factor of a securitization position based on the spread between the rate of the position and the rate on a U.S. Treasury obligation of similar maturity and the movements of an index of securities. This methodology would be designed to adjust specific risk-weighting factors based on changes in the risk characteristics of the individual securitization position relative to changes in the broader market. This methodology would recognizes that when assessing the riskiness of a position relative to a benchmark, a change in the spread of a securitization position should be interpreted differently when comparable market spreads remain stable or when they exhibit volatility.</p>
          <p id="p-218" data-page="79397">A credit spread approach could be based on a scoring model driven by three variables: (1) The spread of the securitization position over U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity; (2) the spread of a high-yield index of corporate exposures (e.g., CDX.HY.B<sup>
        [38]
      </sup>
            ), which captures business cycle conditions; and (3) the maturity of the securitization. The methodology could assign a score on the basis of the following formula:</p>

            (2) the natural logarithm of the median spread on securities included in the CDX.HY.B index over the prior five business days, and (3) the natural logarithm of the maturity of the securitization exposure, expressed in fractions of a year. The specific risk-weighting factor would be assigned on the basis of Table 17 below.</p>

          <p id="p-222" data-page="79397">To construct this methodology, three types of securitization exposures (automobiles, credit cards, and equipment) were examined, and the approach was also tested on securitizations backed by other asset classes, including commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities. This analysis was conducted using different time periods, including before and after the 2008 financial crisis. The analysis indicated that this alternative could yield a reasonable level of credit risk differentiation. However, the agencies chose not to propose this approach in this NPR due to concerns that reliable spread data on many securitization positions would not be readily available. As is the case with other spread-based approaches, the agencies recognize that securitization spreads may be affected by factors other than credit risk, such as illiquidity.</p>

          <br><p><b>Alternative Using a Third-Party Vendor Approach</b></p>
          <p id="p-226" data-page="79398">The agencies also considered the approach used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for determining the regulatory capital requirements for certain securitization positions held by insurance companies. Under such an approach, the agencies would retain one or more third-party vendors to assign risk-based capital requirements for securitization positions. Working with the third-party vendor(s), the agencies would develop a rating system that would evaluate individual securitization positions based on expected loss or probability of default. Each securitization position could be evaluated on a quarterly or annual basis, and could be evaluated more frequently as appropriate, such as when economic conditions or other factors that could affect the performance of the underlying exposures or tranche changed.</p>
          <p id="p-227" data-page="79398">The agencies are concerned that the employment of third-party vendors would have some of the same drawbacks as relying on credit rating agencies. Specifically, the agencies have concerns regarding the use of internal models; the limited number of vendors that possess the expertise and resources necessary to determine an appropriate rating for securitization positions; the potential for overreliance on third-party ratings; and the potential conflicts of interest where a vendor retained by the agencies remains engaged in the business of evaluating securitization positions for other clients.</p>

          <br><p><b>Alternative Permitting the SFA for Advanced Approaches Banks</b></p>
          <p id="p-229" data-page="79398">Both the Basel II standardized and advanced approaches securitization frameworks use a hierarchy of approaches for measuring risk-based capital requirements for securitization exposures. Under the hierarchy of approaches, a bank must use an credit rating from an external credit assessment institution (ECAI), when available. The 2009 revisions allow a bank that has been approved to use the Basel II internal-ratings based approach (IRB) to apply the SFA. However, the Basel II Accord permits use of the SFA only for unrated securitization positions.</p>
          <p id="p-230" data-page="79398">The agencies propose to adopt the SSFA for use by all banks subject to the market risk capital rules. That is, the SFA would not be an option available to advanced approaches banks within the market risk capital rules. The agencies expect that banks should be able to calculate the SSFA. Given concern about potential arbitrage opportunities that would be created if advanced approaches banks were allowed the option to use either the SSFA or the SFA to calculate specific risk capital requirements for their securitization positions, the agencies propose to permit advanced approaches banks to use only the SSFA for purposes of calculating the specific risk-weighting factors for their securitization positions.</p>
          <p id="p-231" data-page="79398">
            <i>Question 20: Should banks that are approved to use the advanced approaches be allowed to use the advanced approaches SFA to calculate specific risk-weighting factors for their securitization positions under the market risk capital rules? If the advanced approaches banks are permitted to use SFA, what safeguards should be put in place to mitigate arbitrage concern?</i>
          </p>
          <p id="p-232" data-page="79398">If the agencies were to allow the use of the SFA for assigning specific risk-weighting factors, the agencies would also consider modifications to the SFA to make it more risk-sensitive and more usable.</p>
          <p id="p-233" data-page="79398">Under the advanced approaches rule, banks are allowed to use the SFA to calculate regulatory capital requirements for securitization positions if certain conditions are met.<sup>
        [40]
      </sup>
            The SFA requires banks to use exposure-specific inputs, including the capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated under the agencies&apos; advanced approaches rule as if the assets were held directly on a bank&apos;s balance sheet. The SFA was designed to allow banks to calculate capital requirements on unrated securitization positions that were originated by the banks holding the exposures. During the ANPR comment period and subsequent interaction with the industry, members of the industry indicated that banks generally do not possess the information necessary to assign a probability of default and loss given default, and hence calculate a capital requirement, for individual wholesale exposures or segments of retail exposures where the underlying securitized positions were not originated by the bank. The commenters proposed that the agencies could modify the methodology for calculating SFA inputs by allowing banks to incorporate pool-level estimates of PD and LGD. To increase risk sensitivity of the approach, pool-level inputs could be used on a quarterly basis.</p>
          
          <p id="p-235" data-page="79398">Although the SFA recognizes credit enhancement provided by funded subordinated positions in a securitization, it does not recognize as a form of credit enhancement additional cash flows available to a securitization from payment of principal and interest. One commenter indicated that the inability to recognize additional cash flows understates the credit enhancement available to certain securitizations, especially automobile and credit card securitizations. Furthermore, this could create competitive issues for U.S. banks in comparison to foreign banks that use the ratings-based approach and internal assessment approach, which may recognize the impact of additional cash flows. In order to address this issue, the commenter proposed allowing the use of cash flow projections to inform the level of credit enhancement recognized under the SFA.</p>

To what extent does use of pool-level inputs camouflage the risk inherent in an asset pool? Are there other issues that should be considered if pool-level inputs are used?</i>

        [41]
      </sup>
            Under regulations issued by the Small Business Administration,<sup>

      </sup>
            a small entity includes a commercial bank or bank holding company with assets of $175 million or less (a small banking organization). As of June 30, 2011, there were approximately 2,450 small bank holding companies, 648 small national banks, 499 small state member banks, and 2,554 small state nonmember banks.</p>

<br><p><b>OCC Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 Determination 
</b></p>

          <p id="p-244" data-page="79399">Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Public Law 104-4 (UMRA) requires that an agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule that includes a Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by state, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year. If a budgetary impact statement is required, section 205 of the UMRA also requires an agency to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives before promulgating a rule.</p>
          <p id="p-245" data-page="79399">The OCC estimates that the overall cost of the proposed rule in the first year of implementation will be approximately $7.4 million. Eliminating start-up costs after the first year, we expect the annual cost in subsequent years to be roughly half of the start-up costs for data acquisition, calculation, and verification. We estimate this ongoing cost at approximately $1.3 million.</p>
          <p id="p-246" data-page="79399">The OCC also recognizes that market risk capital requirements are likely to change under the proposed rule. The largest capital impact of the proposed rule is likely to affect securitizations, corporate debt positions, and exposures to sovereigns. The increased risk sensitivity of the alternative measures of creditworthiness implies that specific risk capital requirements may go down for some trading assets and up for others. For those assets with a higher specific risk capital charge under the proposed rule, however, that increase is likely to be large, in some instances requiring a dollar-for-dollar capital charge.</p>
          <p id="p-247" data-page="79399">At this time the OCC is unable to estimate the capital impact of this NPR with precision. While the impact on certain items (for example, U.S. Treasury Securities) will be zero, the impact on the other asset categories is less clear. For example, the actual impact on the specific risk capital requirements for a bank&apos;s holdings of corporate debt securities will depend on the quality of the assets as determined by the measures of creditworthiness set forth in the NPR. While the OCC anticipates that this impact may be large, the agency lacks the information on the composition and quality of the trading portfolio that would allow us to estimate a likely capital charge. The actual impact on market risk capital requirements also will depend on the extent to which institutions model specific risk.</p>
          <p id="p-248" data-page="79399">For the January 2011 proposal, the OCC derived its estimate of the proposal&apos;s potential effect on market risk capital requirements using the third trading book impact study conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2009 and additional estimates of the capital requirement for standardized securitization exposures and correlation trading positions.<sup>
        [43]
      </sup>
            Based on those assessments, the OCC estimated that the market risk capital requirements for national banks would increase by approximately $51 billion. These new capital requirements would lead banks to deleverage and lose the tax advantage of debt. Therefore, the OCC estimated that the loss of these tax benefits would be approximately $334 million per year. Because the estimated cost of the January 2011 proposal exceeded $100 million annually, the OCC prepared a budgetary impact analysis and identified and considered alternative approaches.<sup>
        [44]
      </sup>
            
          </p>
          
          
          <p id="p-251" data-page="79399">Because the OCC expects that the alternative measures of creditworthiness set forth in this NPR will produce specific risk capital requirements that are comparable to those published by the Basel Committee, the OCC does not expect increased market risk capital requirements due to this NPR to differ substantially from our previous estimate. Thus, the OCC has not included an additional cost of capital component in this assessment, and the overall estimate of the cost of the proposed rule for national banks is $7.4 million in the first year.</p>
          <p id="p-252" data-page="79399">Because the OCC has determined that its portion of this NPR would not result in expenditures by state, local, and tribal governments, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more, the OCC has not prepared a new budgetary impact statement or specifically addressed any new regulatory alternatives.</p>

A [banking organization] must calculate each specific risk add-on in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p>
            <p id="p-359" data-page="79402">(1) The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents purchased credit protection is capped at the market value of the position.</p>

A swap must be included as an effective notional position in the underlying instrument or portfolio, with the receiving side treated as a long position and the paying side treated as a short position. For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with nonlinear payoffs, a [banking organization] must risk weight the market value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or portfolio multiplied by the derivative&apos;s delta.</p>
            <p id="p-361" data-page="79402">(3) For debt, equity, or securitization positions, a [banking organization] may net long and short positions (including derivatives) in identical issues or identical indices. A [banking organization] may also net positions in depositary receipts against an opposite position in an identical equity in different markets, provided that the [banking organization] includes the costs of conversion.</p>

              10. In the context of the market risk capital rules, the specific risk-weighting factor is a scaled measure that is similar to the &#x201C;risk weights&#x201D; used in the general risk-based capital regulations (<i>i.e.,</i> the zero, 20 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent risk weights) for determining risk-weighted assets. The measure for market risk proposed under the January 2011 NPR is multiplied by 12.5 to convert it to market risk equivalent assets, which are then added to the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio.</p>
