Executive Order 13562 of December 27, 2010</b></p>
          
<br><p><b>Recruiting and Hiring Students and Recent Graduates 
</b></p>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="82585">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="82585">
            <span>Section 1.</span>
            <i>Policy.</i> The Federal Government benefits from a diverse workforce that includes students and recent graduates, who infuse the workplace with their enthusiasm, talents, and unique perspectives.  The existing competitive hiring process for the Federal civil service, however, is structured in a manner that, even at the entry level, favors job applicants who have significant previous work experience.  This structure, along with the complexity of the rules governing admission to the career civil service, creates a barrier to recruiting and hiring students and recent graduates.  It places the Federal Government at a competitive disadvantage compared to private-sector employers when it comes to hiring qualified applicants for entry-level positions.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="82585">To compete effectively for students and recent graduates, the Federal Government must improve its recruiting efforts; offer clear paths to Federal internships for students from high school through post-graduate school; offer clear paths to civil service careers for recent graduates; and provide meaningful training, mentoring, and career-development opportunities.  Further, exposing students and recent graduates to Federal jobs through internships and similar programs attracts them to careers in the Federal Government and enables agency employers to evaluate them on the job to determine whether they are likely to have successful careers in Government.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="82585">Accordingly, pursuant to my authority under 5 U.S.C. 3302(1), and in order to achieve a workforce that represents all segments of society as provided in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), I find that conditions of good administration (specifically, the need to promote employment opportunities for students and recent graduates in the Federal workforce) make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain positions in the Federal civil service.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="82585">
            <span>Sec. 2.</span>
            <i>Establishment.</i> There are hereby established the Internship Program and the Recent Graduates Program, which, along with the Presidential Management Fellows Program, as modified herein, shall collectively be known as the Pathways Programs.  I therefore direct the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue regulations implementing the Pathways Programs consistent with this order, including:</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="82585">(a)  a description of the positions that executive departments and agencies (agencies) may fill through the Pathways Programs because conditions of good administration necessitate excepting those positions from the competitive hiring rules;</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="82585">(b)  rules governing whether, to what extent, and in what manner public notice should be provided of job opportunities in the Pathways Programs;</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="82585">(c)  a description of career-development, training, and mentorship opportunities for participants in the Pathways Programs;</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="82585">(d)  requirements that managers meaningfully assess the performance of participants in the Pathways Programs to identify those who should be considered for conversion to career civil service positions;</p>

          <p id="p-10" data-page="82585">(e)  a description of OPM oversight of agency use of the Pathways Programs to ensure that (i) they serve as a supplement to, and not a substitute for,
:::index 79p82586

the competitive hiring process, and (ii) agencies are using the Pathways Programs in a genuine effort to develop talent for careers in the civil service;</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="82586">(f)  a description of OPM plans to evaluate agencies&apos; effectiveness in recruiting and retaining talent using the Pathways Programs and of the satisfaction of Pathways Programs participants and their hiring managers; and</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="82586">(g)  standard naming conventions across agencies, so that students and recent graduates can clearly understand and compare the career pathway opportunities available to them in the Federal Government.</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="82586">
            <span>Sec. 3.</span>
            <i>Internship Program.</i> The Internship Program shall provide students in high schools, community colleges, 4-year colleges, trade schools, career and technical education programs, and other qualifying educational institutions and programs, as determined by OPM, with paid opportunities to work in agencies and explore Federal careers while still in school.  The Internship Program would replace the existing Student Career Experience Program, established pursuant to Executive Order 12015 of October 26, 1977.  The following principles and policies shall govern the Internship Program:</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="82586">(a)  Participants in the program shall be referred to as &#x201C;Interns&#x201D; and shall be students enrolled, or accepted for enrollment, in qualifying educational institutions and programs, as determined by OPM.</p>
          <p id="p-15" data-page="82586">(b)  Subject to any exceptions OPM may establish by regulation, agencies shall provide Interns with meaningful developmental work and set clear expectations regarding the work experience of the intern.</p>
          <p id="p-16" data-page="82586">(c)  Students employed by third-party internship providers but placed in agencies may, to the extent permitted by OPM regulations, be treated as participants in the Internship Program.</p>

            <span>Sec. 4.</span>
            <i>Recent Graduates Program.</i> The Recent Graduates Program shall provide individuals who have recently graduated from qualifying educational institutions or programs with developmental experiences in the Federal Government intended to promote possible careers in the civil service.  The following principles and policies shall govern the Recent Graduates Program:</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="82586">(a)  Participants in the program shall be referred to as &#x201C;Recent Graduates&#x201D; and must have obtained a qualifying degree, or completed a qualifying career or technical education program, as determined by OPM, within the preceding 2 years, except that veterans who, due to their military service obligation, were precluded from participating in the Recent Graduates Program during the 2-year period after obtaining a qualifying degree or completing a qualifying program shall be eligible to participate in the Program within 6 years of obtaining a qualifying degree or completing a qualifying program.</p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="82586">(b)  Responsibilities assigned to a Recent Graduate shall be consistent with his or her qualifications, educational background, and career interests, the purpose of the Recent Graduates Program, and agency needs.</p>
          <p id="p-20" data-page="82586">
            <span>Sec. 5.</span>
            <i>Presidential Management Fellows Program.</i> The Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program is an existing program established pursuant to Executive Order 13318 of November 21, 2003, that aims to attract to the Federal service outstanding men and women from a variety of academic disciplines at the graduate level who have a clear interest in, and commitment to, the leadership and management of public policies and programs.  The following requirements shall govern the PMF Program upon the revocation of Executive Order 13318, as provided in section 8 of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="82586">(a)  Participants in this program shall continue to be known as Presidential Management Fellows (PMFs or Fellows) and must have received, within the preceding 2 years, a qualifying advanced degree, as determined by OPM.</p>

          <p id="p-22" data-page="82586">(b)  Responsibilities assigned to a PMF shall be consistent with the PMF&apos;s qualifications, educational background, and career interests, the purposes of the PMF Program, and agency needs.

          <p id="p-23" data-page="82587">(c)  OPM shall establish the eligibility requirements and minimum qualifications for the program, as well as a process for assessing eligible individuals for consideration for appointment as PMFs.</p>
